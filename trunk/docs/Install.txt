etpub Server Installation
-------------------------

etpub is a server side only modification. This means that it only is
installed on servers and clients do not need to download any files to
play on etpub servers.

To install etpub on your server, you only need to ensure that the
Enemy Territory binary loads the qagame shared library instead of
the default one when it is started. Below we'll describe how to
install etpub for the supported platforms.

Configuration and detailed setup instructions are not covered in this
document. See the directory docs/Example of the etpub distribution for
example configuration files and visit http://etpub.org/ for more
detailed instructions.


Important
---------

We highly recommended that you are using the latest
Wolfenstein - Enemy Territory release, currently version 2.60b,
to set up or running a public etpub dedicated server!


Linux
-----

1) Create a directory named 'etpub' next to the 'etmain' directory in either
   the Enemy Territory installation directory or the ~/.etwolf/ directory of
   the user that runs etded.x86. By default the game installation directory
   is located at /usr/local/games/enemy-territory/.

2) Copy the linux/qagame.mp.i386.so file from the etpub distribution to
   the 'etpub' directory created in step one.

3) If you have decided to use the etpub distribution with Lua API support
   you will need the liblua5.1.so file located in the Enemy Territory
   installation directory where etded.x86 or et.x86 is located.

   Important: Currently etpub's qagame supports Lua 5.1.4.

   3.1) Download the LuaBinaries for Linux from
        http://luabinaries.luaforge.net/download.html (in most cases
		lua5_1_4_Linux26g4_lib.tar.gz).

   3.2) Unzip the downloaded archive and copy the liblua5.1.so file to your
        Enemy Territory installation directory, beside etded.x86 or et.x86.

   3.3) Make sure to have the correct permissions set to liblua5.1.so
        (chmod a=r,u+w liblua5.1.so).

   Hint: If you haven't access to the Enemy Territory installation
         directory, e.g. a rented server, you have to ask your admin
		 to copy the necessary files for you.

4) To use the country flags feature, you will need the GeoIP.dat database file
   located in the 'etpub' directory from step one.

   4.1) Download the compressed GeoIP database file GeoIP.dat.gz from
        http://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/GeoLiteCountry/.

   4.2) Decompress it and copy it into the 'etpub' directory from step one.

5) Ensure that etded or et is called with the additional command line
   arguments '+set fs_game etpub' (in addition to the ones you already use!).


Windows
-------

1) Create a directory named 'etpub' next to the 'etmain' directory in the
   Enemy Territory installation directory. By default the game installation
   directory is located at 'C:\Program Files\Wolfenstein - Enemy Territory'.

2) Copy the win32/qagame_mp_x86.dll file from the etpub distribution to
   the 'etpub' directory created in step one.

3) If you have decided to use the etpub distribution with Lua API support
   you'll need the lua5.1.dll file located in the Enemy Territory installation
   directory where ETDED.exe or ET.exe is located.

   Important: Currently etpub's qagame supports Lua 5.1.4.

   3.1) Download the LuaBinaries for Windows from
        http://luabinaries.luaforge.net/download.html (in most cases
		lua5_1_4_Win32_dll8_lib.zip).

   3.2) Unzip the downloaded archive and copy the lua5.1.dll file to your
        Enemy Territory installation directory, beside ETDED.exe or ET.exe.

   Hint: If you haven't access to the Enemy Territory installation
         directory, e.g. a rented server, you have to ask your admin
		 to copy the necessary files for you.

4) To use the country flags feature, you will need the GeoIP.dat database file
   located in the 'etpub' directory from step one.

   4.1) Download the compressed GeoIP database file GeoIP.dat.gz from
        http://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/GeoLiteCountry/.

   4.2) Decompress it and copy it into the 'etpub' directory from step one.

5) Ensure that ETDED.exe or ET.exe is called with the additional command line
   arguments '+set fs_game etpub' (in addition to the ones you already use!).


Mac OS X
--------

Sorry, Mac OS X support has been dropped for the server version of etpub.


etpub Client Installation
-------------------------

Using the etpub client is however highly recommended and brings
many new features like shoutcasting, country flags, custom huds
or team and class menus.


Linux, Windows and Mac OS X
---------------------------

1) Download the latest etpubc-XXXXXXXX.pk3 file from http://etpub.org/ and
   copy it to the 'etpub' directory.
