<p>This should be set to the name of your shrubbot.cfg file if you want to
enable shrubbot.  See <a href="#shrubbot">shrubbot</a> documentation for
more information about this file.</p>
<p>Example:<pre>g_shrubbot "shrubbot.cfg"</pre></p>
<p>This depends on client's guid, so don't turn this on unless you
have punkbuster enabled or a client > 20100628 installed on your server.</p>
<p>Default is "" (Disabled)</p>

<a name="g_logAdmin"></a>
<dt>g_logAdmin [filename]

<p>Default is "" (no log file)</p>

<a name="g_hitsounds"></a>
<dt>g_hitsounds [integer]
<dd>
<p>This is a bitflag cvar that supports the following values</p>
	<dl>
	<dt>1
	<dd>enables hitsounds
	<dt>2
	<dd>disables hitsounds when shooting wounded players.
	<dt>4
	<dd>disable the headshot sounds when shooting wounded players
            in the head.   default hitsound will be used in it's place
	    unless the 2 flag is set.
	<dt>8
	<dd>disable the &quot;hold your fire&quot; sound that would normally
            be played when shooting a teammate for the first time.
	<dt>16
	<dd>disable hitsounds from poison damage.
	<dt>32
	<dd>disable hitsounds from explosive weapons.
	</dl>
<p>A client will hear a sound when they damage another player.
The sounds it uses are ones that are included in the pak0.pk3 file so it
does not require additonal file downloads to use this mod.</p>
<p>
A client can
disable hitsounds by running <pre>/setu cg_hitsounds 0</pre> before connecting
to the server, or toggle hitsounds on the fly with the /hitsounds command.
</p><p>
Starting with 0.1.1, the hitsounds used are configurable with the following cvars:<pre>
g_hitsound_default (Default is "sound/weapons/impact/flesh2.wav")
g_hitsound_helmet (Default is "sound/weapons/impact/metal4.wav")
g_hitsound_head (Default is "sound/weapons/impact/flesh4.wav")
g_hitsound_team_default (Default is "sound/weapons/impact/flesh2.wav")
g_hitsound_team_helmet (Default is "sound/weapons/impact/metal4.wav")
g_hitsound_team_head (Default is "sound/weapons/impact/flesh4.wav")
g_hitsound_team_warn_axis (Default is "sound/chat/axis/26a.wav")
g_hitsound_team_warn_allies (Default is "sound/chat/allies/26a.wav")
</pre></p>
<p>Note that these are server cvars.  If you want to use hitsounds that are not included in
the game you'll have to put them in a pk3 for all clients to download. Your custom hitsounds
must be 22khz, 16 bit, mono WAV files in order for ET to be able to use them.</p>

</p>

<a name="g_shoveNoZ"></a>
<dt>g_shoveNoZ [0|1]

</p>
<p>
Starting in 0.2.1 players can also type '/m tjw you totally suck' in the
'chat' dialog box and it will be recognized as a private message.
</p>

<p>

<a name="g_XPSave"></a>
<dt>g_XPSave [integer]
<dd>
<p>If set to 1, XP and number of lives remaining will be saved if a player
disconnects and reconnects later during the same campaign.
As of 0.1.1, this is now a bitflag with the following values:</p>
<dl>
<dt>1<dd>store xp when a client disconnects
<dt>2<dd>don't reset xp to the pre-map start values on a map restart,
shuffle, etc.
<dt>4<dd>never reset xp (ever).
<dt>8<dd>force the disconnection of clients with the same GUID as the connecting
    client.  This is useful in saving the stored XP of players with unreliable
    network connections since they should still get their stored XP even if
    reconnecting immediately with a new IP address.<br>
    This feature is enabled by default unless you have sv_wwwDlDisconnected
    enabled.   sv_wwwDlDisconnected seems to interfere with this feature, so
    do not enable this flag if you change pk3's on your server often because
    stored XP will be lost over disconencted downloads.
<dt>16<dd>store the xp at restarts, nextmaps, mapvotes, campaignvotes and
	similar cases.
</dl>
<p>Storing XP on disconnect depends on client's guid, so don't turn this on unless you
have punkbuster enabled or a client > 20100628 installed on your server.</p>
<p>Default is 0</p>

<a name="g_XPSaveFile"></a>
<dt>g_XPSaveFile [string]
<dd>
<p>
Set this to the filename you want XPSave to store data in.  This file
will be relative to your fs_game directory (like g_shrubbot).
</p>
<p>Default is &quot;xpsave.cfg&quot;
</p>

<a name="g_XPSaveMaxAge_xp"></a>
<dt>g_XPSaveMaxAge_xp [integer]
<dd>
<p>
The number of seconds that must pass without a connection from this
player before XPSave forgets his/her xp skills.
<p>Starting with 0.8.1, you can use a modifier for this value.  Here are some examples:</p>
<p>
set g_XPSaveMaxAge_xp "1o" - 1 month<br />
set g_XPSaveMaxAge_xp "2w" - 2 weeks<br />
set g_XPSaveMaxAge_xp "5d" - 5 days<br />
set g_XPSaveMaxAge_xp "36h" - 36 hours<br />
set g_XPSaveMaxAge_xp "120m" - 120 minutes
</p>

<p>
NOTE: if <a href="#g_XPSaveMaxAge">g_XPSaveMaxAge</a> is less than
g_XPSaveMaxAge_xp, g_XPSaveMaxAge will be used.
</p>
</p>
<p>Default is 1d
</p>

<a name="g_XPSaveMaxAge"></a>
<dt>g_XPSaveMaxAge [integer]
<dd>
<p>
The number of seconds that must pass without a connection from this
player before XPSave forgets his/her skills/killrating/playerrating/mute
status.
</p>
<p>Starting with 0.8.1, you can use a modifier for this value.  Here are some examples:</p>
<p>
set g_XPSaveMaxAge "1o" - 1 month<br />
set g_XPSaveMaxAge "2w" - 2 weeks<br />
set g_XPSaveMaxAge "5d" - 5 days<br />

<a name="g_XPDecay"></a>
<dt>g_XPDecay [integer]
<dd>
<p>This is a bitmask that controls the XP decay feature.  The following
bitflags are supported:</p>
	<dl>
	<dt>1
	<dd>Enable XP Decay
	<dt>2
	<dd>Do not decay a player's XP when they are disconnected from the
	    server.

	<dt>16
	<dd>Do not decay a player's XP during warmup/intermission.
	<dt>32

            playing.
	</dl>
<p>See also <a href="#g_XPDecayRate">g_XPDecayRate</a>.</p>
<p>This feature was created in response to the g_XPSave 4 flag which allows
XP to continue building forever.</p>
<p>Default is 0</p>

<a name="g_XPDecayRate">
<dt>g_XPDecayRate [float]
<dd>
<p>This is the rate (in skillpoints per second) that XP skill points for each
skill will decay when <a href="#g_XPDecay">g_XPDecay</a> is enabled.</p>

<p>Setting this to 0.1 would result in a player losing 6 points per minute IN ALL
SKILLS, so up to 42XP per minute if the player has skill points for each skill.</p>

<p>Starting with 0.8.1, you can use a modifier for this value.  Here are some examples:</p>
<p>
set g_xpDecayRate "5000/o" - Decay 5000xp per skill per month<br />
set g_xpDecayRate "1000/w" - Decay 1000xp per skill per week<br />
set g_xpDecayRate "500/d" - Decay 500xp per skill per day<br />
set g_xpDecayRate "40/h" - Decay 40xp per skill per hour<br />
set g_xpDecayRate "2/m" - Decay 2xp per skill per minute
</p>

<p>Default is 0.0</p>

<a name="g_XPDecayFloor">
<dt>g_XPDecayFloor [float]
<dd>
<p>
This is the minimum that any particular skill can be reduced to by g_XPDecay.
</p>
<p>
For example, setting this to 140.0 will ensure that no player will ever lose
rank or skill levels due to g_XPDecay.
</p>
<p>Default is 0.0</p>

<a name="g_maxXP">
<dt>g_maxXP [integer]
<dd>
<p>
This is a vicious cvar that will reset a players XP once their overall XP
score reaches it.  It has been requested by those who run servers with XPSave
that never resets.</p>
<p>
Set this to -1 to disable it.</p>
<p>
Default is -1 (disabled)</p>

<a name="g_maxXPResetWarn">
<dt>g_maxXPResetWarn [integer]
<dd>
<p>Displays a message warning players whose XP is close to being reset due to
the g_maxXP setting.  The warning is displayed every thirty seconds once the
warning threshold is passed.</p>
<p>This setting can have an integer value (eg, 950), in which case it means that
the player will be warned every thirty seconds once he has more than 950 XP.</p>
<p>This setting can also have percentage value (eg, "90%"), and that will cause
the warnings to start when the player reaches 90% of g_maxXP XP.</p>
<p>If you specify a negative value, players will be warned when that offset is
hit.  For example:</p>
<p>For a value of -75, warnings will to display then players have g_maxXP - 75 XP</p>
<p>For a value of -2%, warnings will display when players have 98% of g_maxXP</p>

<p>Set this to 0 to disable it.</p>
<p>Default is 0</p>

<a name="g_goomba"></a>
<dt>g_goomba [integer]
<dd>
<p>
If set to a positive integer, players can damage each other by landing
on each other.   The integer is multiplier that determines how much
damage should be done to the player that was fallen on.  Also
the impact for the falling player will be broken so that they
only recieve 20% of the damage they would have normally.  It is also
possible to do small amounts of damage (5HP) to other players by hopping
up and down on them.
</p>

<p>
Falling damage can be either 500, 50, 25, 15, or 10 depending on
the length of the fall.  So if you set g_goomba to 5 and land on a
player from a fall that would have damaged you 10HP, you will inflict
50HP of damage on the player you land on, and you will only recieve 2HP of
damage.
</p>

g_ATB controls the type of active team balancing you want to use. Active team
balancing will automatically move one of the top three player(s) from the
team more likely to win, to the team more likely to lose. There are currently
two versions. One uses XP, the other playerrating. Set g_ATB to choose between
them. Note that g_ATB only decides WHEN to move a player, and NOT which player
to move. See <a href="#g_ATB_rating">g_ATB_rating</a> to see how ATB chooses
which player to move.

		<li>The resulting team change will not give one team an advantage by number of players unless:
			<ol>
			<li>If 16 or more people are playing, the losing team may get up to a
				1 player advantage.
			<li>If 26 or more people are playing, the losing team may get up to a
				2 player advantage.
			</ol>
		<li>The winning team is ahead in team XP by a margin of g_ATB_fidd
		 percent.
		</ol>
		<p>For example, setting <pre>g_ATB_diff 50</pre> a player would be
		moved if he/she was the top player on the team and his/her team had 750XP and
		the other team had 500XP.</p>
		<p>You can also adjust the rate at which ATB moves players with the
		g_ATB_axisHoldoff (default 5)  and g_ATB_alliedHoldoff (default 5) cvars.
		For example, if g_ATB_axisHoldoff is set to 5 and an axis player is moved
		to the allied team, ATB will take no other action until the axis spawn timer
		cycles 5 times.</p>
		<p>NOTE: this calculation is based on <b>TeamXP</b> NOT the total XP of all
		the players on the team.  TeamXP is the total score earned for the team by
		all players on the team during the map.  When a player changes teams, the
		TeamXP they earned for their team does not move with them.</p>
		<p>Default values:</p>
		<p>
		g_ATB_diff: 70<br>
		g_ATB_minXP: 300<br>
		g_ATB_minPlayers: 5<br>
		g_ATB_axisHoldoff: 5<br>
		g_ATB_alliedHoldoff: 5

	<dt>2
	<dd>Use player rating to balance the teams. This will balance the teams by
	moving one of the the top 3 players when the probability of one team winning
	exceeds g_ATB_diff. g_ATB_diff is an integer and defaults
	to 70 meaning 70%. If the Axis team has more than a 70% chance of winning,
	ATB will move one of its players to the Allies, and this will often instantly
	lower the probability enough that another move will not be necessary. This
	version will not use any of the XP version's variables and it uses
	<a href="#g_playerRating_minplayers">g_playerRating_minplayers</a>
	instead of g_ATB_minPlayers as the minimum number of players that must
	be playing before it will act. It will also not swap players between teams
	since unbalanced team numbers is fine with player rating. It will actually
	stack team numbers on purpose to even out the teams unless g_ATB_swap is
	set.
	<p>
	Note: Read
	<a href="#g_teamForceBalance_playerrating">g_teamForceBalance_playerrating</a>
	carefully also. You probably don't want to turn option 2 on until after
	running your server long enough to learn map and player stats.

<a name="g_maxWarp"></a>
<dt>g_maxWarp [integer]
<dd>
<p>This allows you to control the amount of "warping" that players with
high packet loss can do.  The [integer] is the number of server frames
that you allow a player to miss before their next movement is put in
check.
</p><p>
A server frame is 50ms on a typical server (sv_fps set to 20).  This
means that if you set g_maxWarp to 5 you won't allow players to warp
from point A to point B if that distance takes an normal player 1/4
of a second to travel. Setting this to 1 is a good way to drive off
just about everyone from your server.
</p><p>
As far as I can tell, 1000ms is allowed by default in the game, so
setting this to any value higher than 39 should have no effect if
sv_fps is set to 10.

<a name="g_dropObj"></a>
<dt>g_dropObj [integer]
<dd>
<p>Sets the number of times a player can drop/toss the objective
(e.g. parts on radar) per life.</p><p>
The parts are dropped by pressing the +activate key
(usually bound to F) when there's nothing else around to be
activated.
</p><p>
Before enabling this recall how spammy the voiceovers can be.
Then picture a player tossing the parts to himself over and
over again.  For this reason you probably don't want to set
this very high.
</p><p>
Starting in 0.4.4 players must switch to knife in order to drop the
objective.  If they are not holding knife and hit +activate they will
see a message that notifies them that they must switch to knife.  This
change was made to prevent accidental dropping of the objective when
trying to push, drag, pick up, or activate something else.

<p>
These variables allow customization of the experience points necessary to go
up in ranks.  These settings consist of four space-separated integers
indicating the number of XP required to go up a rank.  A string such as
"3 10 10 10" indicates that 3 points are required to go up the first rank,
and the next three ranks are granted when the players has 10 points.  If, for
example, you want to grant akimbo pistols upon the first kill, you would set
skill_lightweapons to "3 3 3 3".  The default for each of these variables is
"20 50 90 140". You can also grant levels upon connection byt using a value
like "0 0 20 100".  This would mean that the first two ranks would be granted
upon connection, and the third and fourth ranks would be granted at 20 and 100
points, respectively.

<a name="g_serverInfo"></a>
<dt>g_serverInfo [bitmask]
<dd>
<p>Use this cvar to change the behaviour of the 'serverinfo' string.  This string
is printed in response to the 'getstatus' primative command used by
game browsers.  This is a bitflag cvar that currently accepts the
following flags:</p>
	<dl>
	<dt>1
	<dd>
	Display player team information using the 'P' cvar in the server info
	string. (etpro and etmain 2.60 behaviour)
	<dt>2
	<dd>
	Display player team information using the 'Players_Axis' and
	'Players_Allies' cvars in the server info string.
	(etmain < 2.60 behaviour)
	<dt>4
	<dd>
	Display the 'campaign_maps' cvar in the server info string.  This
	contains a comma delimited list off all the maps in the current
	campaign.  Only works if you have g_gametype set to 4.
	<dt>8
	<dd>
	Displays the 'C' CVAR in the server info string.  This is a string
	containing the current map number in the campaign, and total maps in
	current campaign, in the form of &quot;xx,yy&quot;.  Only works if
	you have g_gametype set to 4.
	<dt>16
	<dd>
	Starting with 0.5.1, the class charge times will not be present
	in the server info string unless this flag is set.   They were
	removed by default in order to make room in the serverInfo string
	for more useful information.
	These cvars are g_medicChargeTime, g_engineerChargeTime,
	g_LTChargeTime, g_covertopChargeTime, g_soldierChargeTime.
	<dt>32
	<dd>
	Send KR (KillRating) instead of XP in SERVERINFO string.  This is overriden
	by flag 64.
	<dt>64
	<dd>
	Send PR (PlayerRating) instead of XP/KR in SERVERINFO string. Overrides
	flag 32.
	</dl>
<p>
NOTE: <b>this cvar MUST be set prior to loading the first map.</b>  You
will not be able to change this cvar once the game code is loaded.
</p>

<p>
NOTE: the serverInfo string has a fixed length of 1024 characters.  This
space is shared with any cvar you create on your server with the 'sets'
command.  If you use up too much space with 'sets', your server will
fail to start.  It will print the message
&quot;Info string length exceeded&quot; if you don't have enough space left
in your serverinfo string to handle the g_serverInfo flags you've selected.
To fix this, either remove some sets cvars from your config, or use
different g_serverInfo flags.
<p>
Default is 1.

<a name="g_killRating"></a>
<dt>g_killRating [bitmask]
<dd>
<p>
When not set to 0 etpub will track a player's killing ability using an
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELO_rating_system">ELO type statistic</a>
similar to chess. Each kill will increase a player's kill rating
based on how hard the kill was. Killing unskilled players will result in very
few points whereas an unskilled player killing a skilled player will result in
more points. Kill rating also takes into account the weapon used (less for
arty, more for knife).
</p><p>
Here are the bitflag options:</p>
	<dl>
	<dt>1
	<dd>Use kill rating. A dummy flag since any non-zero value for g_killRating
	    will enable it.
	<dt>2
	<dd>Make kill rating visible. Players can use /killrating and at the end of
	    each map a message will display the top killers for the map and
	    overall.
	<dt>4
	<dd>Log files will include the GUIDs of the players involved in kills. This makes
            kill tracking a lot easier.
	</dl>
<p>
NOTE: in 0.5.x there was a 4 flag that allowed killRating to be used for
shuffle.  This has been deprecated.  This is now controlled through the
<a href="#g_shuffle_rating">g_shuffle_rating</a> cvar.

<a name="g_playerRating"></a>
<dt>g_playerRating [bitmask]
<dd>
<p>
When not set to 0 etpub will track a player's ability to win against good teams
using an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELO_rating_system">
ELO type statistic</a> similar to chess. Each win will increase a player's
rating based on how hard the opposing team was. Skilled teams defeating less
skilled teams will result in very few points whereas an relatively low-
rated team defeating a good team will result in more points. Player rating also
takes into account the number of players on each team (less points when a very
large defeats a small one) and which side tends to win more often on the
current map (e.g. Allies tend to win tc_base).
</p><p>
Here are the bitflag options:</p>
	<dl>
	<dt>1
	<dd>Use player rating. A dummy flag since any non-zero value for g_playerRating
	    will enable it.
	<dt>2
	<dd>Make player rating visible. Players can use /playerrating and at the end of
	    each map a message will display the top player.
	<dt>4
	<dd>Put player rating on the scoreboard instead of the XP.  This setting will likely
	    go away when a new version of the etpub client has this built-in
	<dt>8
	<dd>Print out extra info at the end of a round that can be used to further refine
	    the playerrating model.

<a name="g_playerRating_mapPad"></a>
<dt>g_playerRating_mapPad [integer]
<dd>
<p>On an etpub installation with little statistics history, !howfair will not print out very
accurate data.  g_playerRating_mapPad is a cvar that attempts to stabilize early !howfair results
by adding a number of fake wins to each team.  If you set it to 50, it starts with Axis = 50,
Allies = 50 wins. This yields a map rating of 50% for both teams on that map. For every 2 real
games played, 1 map pad value is ignored. So after 100 games, map pad is ignored (replaced with
real games).</p>
<p>The higher map pad, the longer the values will stay near 50-50.</p>
<p>Default is 50</p>

<a name="g_playerRating_minplayers"></a>
<dt>g_playerRating_minplayers [integer]
<dd>
<p>
The minimum number of players that must participate in a map in order for it
to count towards each player's player rating.
</p>
<p>Default is 8 (e.g. 4v4)
</p>

<a name="g_teamForceBalance_playerrating"></a>
<dt>g_teamForceBalance_playerrating [0..100]
<dd>
<p>
Set to 0 to disable.  <i>If this setting is enabled, it overrides g_teamForceBalance.</i>
If g_teamForceBalance_playerrating is non-zero, etpub will
not allow players to join a team whose chances of winning are already above
g_teamForceBalance_playerrating. The winning chance is calculated using 3 things:
the average player rating of the team, the number of players on each team, and
how often each team wins the current map (e.g. Allies usually win tc_base). If
the team being joined rates too highly, a message will tell the player to join
the other team.
<br><br>
Important Notes:
<br>
First of all, g_teamForceBalance_playerrating WILL allow unbalanced numbers to
offset map or team difficulty. If the Axis has VERY good players, it will allow
the Allies to have a few more players than Axis, given a map that is equally
difficult for both sides to win. Also, given teams equal in skill,
g_teamForceBalance_playerrating will force Allies to have a large team if the
map is almost always won by Axis.
<br><br>
Because g_teamForceBalance_playerrating uses info tracked over time, it may be
best to run through your cycle or campaign a few times without it before turning
it on, so that it can learn how good the players are, and how hard the maps are.
<br><br>
If you want an idea why it's working a certain way, use the !listteams command
server console (or game). This will show you how many points each team is
predicted to win. If a team is going to win less than 4 points, it's too good.
The other information shows you the breakdown of how the points are calculated.
<br>
<pre>
Ratings       Win Prob       Win Points
---------------------------------------------
Allies          0.65            5
Axis            0.35           10
</pre>
The above says that Axis has a 35% chance of winning based on the players and
map. It takes into account the number of players per team also. The points
are calculated as 16*(1 - win prob). So there you have it.
<br><br>
Remember, g_teamForceBalance_playerrating is contantly adapting, so if it seems
dumb at first, give it some time to adapt to your server. Maybe don't turn it on
for the first week.

<a name="g_stats"></a>
<dt>g_stats [integer]
<dd>
<p>This is a bitflag cvar used to control the way statistics are handled.
The following flags are supported:</p>
	<dl>
	<dt>1
	<dd>When shooting a corpse to gib, do not count it as a hit.
	<dt>2
	<dd>When shooting a corpse to gib, do not count it as a shot.

<p>Default is 0</p>

<a name="g_tyranny"></a>
<dt>g_tyranny [0|1]
<dd>
<p>
This cvar controls the use of administrator commands that could
be used by admins to cheat or abuse players.  If it is set to
0 you will not be able to use commands on your server such as !gib,
!slap, !burn, etc.
</p>
<p>
Also, you will not be able to use g_logOptions flag 256 (log private
messages) unless g_tyranny is enabled.
</p>
<p>
g_tyranny must also be enabled in order to specify a client in
using the 'playsound' server command.
</p>
<p>
'g_tyranny' and its value appear in the serverInfo string to serve
as a warning for perspective players.
</p>
<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> If you enable this, you MUST do so immediately when the server
	starts (before the first map is loaded).  This means putting
	<pre>set g_tyranny 1 </pre> in the .cfg file that is exec'ed on
	server start.  If you try to change this on a running server,
	you will get the message <pre>g_tyranny is read only.</pre>

</p>
<p>
Default is 0
</p>

<a name="g_mapScriptDirectory"></a>
<dt>g_mapScriptDirectory [string]
<dd>
<p>
Similar to ETPro's b_mapscriptsdirectory.  Set it to the name of a
directory in your fs_path that contains custom map scripts.
</p>
<p>
For example you can copy the 'etpromapscripts' directory from the
ETPro distribution to your 'etpub' directory and add: <pre>
set g_mapScriptDirectory "etpromapscripts"</pre> to your cfg.
</p>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> It is strongly recommended that you use the map scripts distributed
with etpub since these updated scripts fix very important bugs in some of the original
map scripts.
</p>
<p>
Setting g_mapScriptDirectory to &quot;&quot; disables any use of map .script files.
</p>
<p>
Default is &quot;&quot;
</p>

<a name="g_campaignFile"></a>
<dt>g_campaignFile [string]
<dd>
<p>Similar to ETPro's b_campaignFile.  If you set this to the name
of a file in your fs_path it will be interpreted as a .campaign
script and all other .campaign scripts in your pk3 files will be
ignored.
</p>
<p>
This is useful for making custom campaigns since you don't need to
offer a pk3 file containing a custom .campaign script for all clients
to download.  However, if the client has not downloaded this .campaign
file in a pk3, they will not see information about the campaign.
Such information includes:
	<ul>
	<li>will not display in the VOTE -> MAP list
	<li>map locations will not draw on the map of Europe.
	<li>campaign description will not draw in the right panel
	<li>total number of maps and current maps order in the campaign
            will not be shown in the intermission screens.
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
Also, even though the built-in campaigns cmpgn_centraleurope and
cmpgn_northafrica will not be valid, they will still appear in the
client's VOTE -> MAP menu.  If a vote for one of them passes, nothing
will happen.
</p>

Setting this to &quot;&quot; disables it.

</p>

<a name="g_fear"></a>
<dt>g_fear [integer]
<dd>
<p>
If a player uses the /kill command within g_fear milliseconds after
taking damage from an enemy, the attacker that last damaged that player
will recieve full credit for the kill and the mode of death will be
recorded as MOD_FEAR.  Other restrictions are that the attacker must be
on the opposite team and the attacker must still be alive.
</p>
<p>As of 0.7.2, g_fear applies also to players that try to switch teams
within g_fear milliseconds.  The player will remain in the same team and
the usual g_fear behavior applies.</p>
<p>
In-game statistics will reflect that the death
was caused by the weapon that did the last recorded damage to the player.
</p>

<a name="g_obituary"></a>
<dt>g_obituary [integer]
<dd>
<p>
This cvar controls how player Obituaries are handled.  Obituarys are the

notify all players of another player's death.
</p>

<p>Available options are:
	<dl>
	<dt>0
	<dd>Obituaries are disabled.

	<dt>1
	<dd>All Obituaries will ALWAYS be handled by the client with
	the EV_OBITUARY event.  Since the etmain client does not know
	about some etpub MODs (e.g. MOD_GOOMBA) the default message
	will be printed for those deaths.

	<dt>2
	<dd>Only those Obituaries that the etmain client knows how to handle
	will be handled by the client.  If someone is killed by a MOD that
	the etmain client doesn't know about, the Obituary is generated by the
	server.

	<dt>3
	<dd>All Obituaries are handled by the server and the EV_OBITUARY event
	is never sent to the client.  This results in
	&quot;Instant Obituaries&quot;.  This comes at the cost of increased
	network bandwidth and absence of the skull icon in the obituaries.
	(when using this option, you can use
	<a href="obituaries.html">Custom Obituaries</a> starting with

Example <pre>
set g_speed 320
set g_healthSpeedStart 64
set g_healthSpeedBottom 50</pre>
A player with a maxhealth of 100 (level 0 non medic) will have a speed of 320
until he reaches a health of 64. From that moment his health will be decreasing
linear if he gets hurt. This linear decrement will continue untill he reaches a
health of 1. At that moment his speed will be 50% of g_speed (so 160). At the
moment he has 32 health, his speed will be 75% of g_speed (so 240). A speed
decrement is not permanent: when he gets healed his speed will increase lineair
or even be 320 again when he has 64 hp or more.

Note that settings this cvars higher than 100 or below 0 will not work.<br>

<a name="mapvoting"></a>
<h3>Map Voting</h3>
<p>With the release of etpub 0.7.1, a new g_gametype of 6 is introduced. This gametype
allows, when used in conjunction with an etpub_client > 20060310, for the players to
decide on the map that is played next. When g_gametype is set to 6, and the client
is using the appropriate client, a new screen is introduced during intermission. This
screen list, depending on server configuration, a list of up to 32 maps that are loaded
on the server, and that all players can vote on.  Once intermission ends, the server
totals the votes, and plays the next map based upon the vote results</p>
<p>The following cvars control how map voting operates</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#g_mapVoteFlags">g_mapVoteFlags</a>
<li><a href="#g_maxMapsVotedFor">g_maxMapsVotedFor</a>
<li><a href="#g_minMapAge">g_minMapAge</a>
<li><a href="#g_resetXPMapCount">g_resetXPMapCount</a>
</ul>
Miscellaneous notes about mapvoting:
<ul>
<li>Total maps allowed is 32.  If server admin has more than 32 .bsp files, only the
    first 32 are used
<li>Tie breaker.  The default tie-breaker is such that if 2 or more maps are tied with
    the same number of votes, the map that was played most recently is selected.
<li>Bots and connecting players do NOT count for mapvoting, everyone else (including
    spectators) does.
<li>If no maps are voted for, the default "nextmap" cvar is used, so server admins
    have to specify a default map cycle of sort, usually in the following format.<br>
    <em>set d1 "set g_gametype 6 ; map oasis ; set nextmap vstr d2"<br>
    set d2 "set g_gametype 6 ; map battery ; set nextmap vstr d3"<br>
    set d3 "set g_gametype 6 ; map goldrush ; set nextmap vstr d1"<br>
    vstr d1<br></em>
    This means that the default map, upon server start, will be oasis.  From there,
    map voting will be used.  If at any point, no map is voted for, battery will
    be played, etc
</ul>

<a name="statistics"></a><h3>Statistics / Rankings Terms</h3>
<p>There are several settings in ETPub that attempt to determine how "good" a player is
in terms (hopefully) more meaningful than just XP or XP per unit of time.  Here are the
terms used and their definitions:</p>

<dl>
<dt>Kill Rating
<dd><p>How good of a killer the player is, based on how many other players the player kills,
and their kill rating.  In other words, killing players with a high kill rating increases
the shooter's kill rating more than killing players with a low kill rating.</p>

<dt>Player Rating
<dd><p>This is a measure of how much the player contributes to winning a map.  This
measure is calculated by seeing how many times this player is on the winning team after
every map, and how good the opposing team was. Like kill rating, winning against teams with a high average player rating results in player rating increasing faster.</p>

<dt>Win Probability
<dd><p>The probability that a team will win a map (based on the players' player rating,
team size, and the map).</p>

</dl>

<p>These statistics are gathered by etpub and the data is saved to local files on disk.</p>

<p>The etpub development team member responsible for implementing these player rankings and
ratings is Josh Menke.  He has been kind enough to begin working on an academic write-up
to explain the mathematics and statistics methods behind these rankings.  Due to time
constraints the document is being gradually updated and expanded. The latest version can
be seen at:

<p>List KillRating info by team, sorted.</p>

<a name="m"></a>
<dt>m [slot#|name] [message]
<dd>
<p>Send a private message to a player. A partial name match can be used, and in
this case the private message will be sent to all users that match the partial
name</p>

<a name="playsound"></a>
<dt>playsound [slot#|name] [filename]
<dd>
<p>Plays the specified sound file.  The slot number/player name parameter is optional.
If the slot number or playername is specified, only that player hears the sound,
otherwise all players hear the sound.  g_tyranny must be enabled in order to play a
sound to a specific player.</p>

<a name="playsound_env"></a>
<dt>playsound_env [slot#|name] [filename]
<dd>
<p>Plays the specified sound file, but the sound can be heard by everyone near the
specified player.  In contrast to playsound, both parameters are required for
playsound_env.  If playsound_env is used with one parameter (only the the filename
is specified), then it is treated exactly as playsound [filename].  The further
away nearby players are, the less they hear the sound. g_tyranny must be enabled
in order to use this command.</p>

<a name="shrubbot"></a><h3>Shrubbot</h3>
<p>
shrubbot is an <a href="http://www.etstats.com/shrubet/index.php?ver=2&id=10">
invention</a> of Ryan Mannion.  etpub tries to clone shubbot as accurately
as possible, both in user interface and in the shrubbot configuration file
(usually called "shrubbot.cfg").
</p>

Below are the shrubbot commands that etpub currently supports and the
corresponding flag to be used in the shrubbot config file to give permission
to the command:

<dt>@
<dd>&quot;incognito&quot; flag shows the admin as level 0 with no a.k.a info

<dt>&
<dd>Can rename himself regardless of
    <a href="#g_maxNameChanges">g_maxNameChanges</a> limit
</dl>
<br>
The following operators are supported in the flags field:
<dl>
<dt>*
<dd>This means all all available flags
    are granted (except ! and @).  Any flags that
    come after the * are negated.  So for example:
<pre>
[level]
level    = 5
name     =
flags    = *xU
greeting =
greeting_sound =
</pre>
would give level 5 admins all commands except !lol and !burn.
<dt>-
<dd>This subtracts the flags that follow it from the allowed flags.
Example:
<pre>
[admin]
name     = tjw
guid     = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
level    = 5
flags    = -bs
greeting =
greeting_sound =
</pre>
would give tjw all of the commands a level 5 admin has except !ban
and !setlevel.<br>
NOTE: this operator is for admin flags only.

<dt>+
<dd>This is pretty useless since it is implied that any flags will be
appended anyway unless they follow '-'.  Therefore, the only use for
this operator is for use after the '-' operator.
Example:
<pre>
[admin]
name     = tjw
guid     = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
level    = 5
flags    = -bs+U
greeting =
greeting_sound =
</pre>
would give tjw all of the commands a level 5 user has except !ban and
!setlevel, but he also gets the !burn command which typical level 5
admins do not have.<br>
NOTE: this operator is for admin flags only.
</dl>

<p>
The configuration file itself is layed out in blocks serpated by blank lines.
The three types of blocks supported are [level], [admin], and [ban].
If you ever need to edit the shrubbot.cfg file by hand,  you need to run the
!readconfig command (or restart etded) to load it.
</p>

<p>
When setting up a new shrubbot.cfg file, simply set the g_shrubbot cvar to
the name you want to use for the configuration file, then connect to the
server with your et, and run the following command in the <b>server</b> console:
<pre>!setlevel ETPlayer 5</pre>
(where ETPlayer is your name).  This will create the shrubbot.cfg file with
default levels and your guid set to level 5 admin (the highest default level).
You can then edit the level definitions in this file to match your preferences
and run the !readconfig command to load them up.
</p>

<p>
Starting with etpub 0.7.1, the new element [command] has been added to the
shrubbot file format.  This allows server admins to create their own
shrubbot commands for executing server commands.  Here are some examples:
</p>
<pre>
[command]
command  = hello
exec     = cp "hello world"
desc     = Center Print the text "hello world" to all connected clients
levels   = 0 1 2 3 4 5

[command]
command  = panzeroff
exec     = set team_maxPanzers 0
desc     = Turn off panzers
levels   = 5

[command]
command  = havefun
exec     = exec fun.cfg
desc     = Load up some crazy settings/commands
levels   = 5

[command]
command  = unlimitedpanzers
exec     = cp "^1Unlimited panzers!"; set team_maxPanzers -1
desc     = Everyone can have a panzerfaust!
levels   = 5
</pre>

<p>
This would create 4 new commands, !hello, !panzeroff, !havefun, and
!unlimitedpanzers.  !hello can be run by any user with an admin level
0 through 5.  !panzeroff, !havefun, and !unlimitedpanzers would be
executable by only level 5 users.  You must name each level in the
space seperated level string (a higher level does not grant authority).
As shown in !unlimitedpanzers, you can separate commands with a semicolon (;).
</p>

<p>
Starting with etpub 0.8.1 [command] elements can use shortcut characters
as described in <a href="#g_shortcuts">g_shortcuts</a>. Shortcuts will work
with [command] elements regardless of the <a href="#g_shortcuts">g_shortcuts</a>
settings. With etpub 0.9.1 you can use a new shortcut [i] to replace it with
the player ID of the calling player.
</p>

<p>Here are some samples:</p>

<pre>
[command]
command  = spec
exec     = !putteam [n] s
desc     = Become a spectator
levels   = 0 1 2 3 4 5

[command]
command  = pizza
exec     = cp "[n] ^7orders a big pizza for everyone except [d]^7!"
desc     = Some message
levels   = 3 4 5

[command]
command  = ms
exec     = makeshoutcaster [i]
desc     = Makes you a shoutcaster
levels   = 5
</pre>

<p>Also starting with etpub 0.8.1 [command] elements can use up to 9
parameter placeholders (from [1] to [9]) in the commands.  For example, given
the following definition:</p>

<pre>
[command]
command  = mynameis
exec     = cp "[n]'s ^7real-life name is [1]^7!"
desc     = Print real name
levels   = 0 1 2 3 4 5
</pre>

<p>When a user types the command like this:</p>

<pre>!mynameis bartholomew</pre>

<p>Will print out something like:<p>

<pre>[JJJJ]zuxx0r's real-life name is bartholomew</pre>

<p>
Parameters that the user does not type in are left blank in your command.  You
can use the parameters in any order (so the user types the parameters in a
different order than they are used).
</p>

<p>
These commands will show up like any other shrubbot command in the output of
!help and the !help command will also provide detailed info for the command
using the 'desc' paramter (e.g. '!help hello')
</p>

<p>Starting with etpub 0.8.1 you can also add a greeting to [admin] and [level]
blocks. This greeting will be displayed when a shrubbot admin connects to the server.
Adding a greeting to a [level] block will show that greeting for every admin with
that level, while adding a greeting to an [admin] block will only show the greeting
when that particular admin connects. When both [level] and [admin] blocks contain a
greeting, the [admin] greeting is used.
When you type [n] in a greeting, it will be replaced by the name of the connecting
admin.

Example:
</p>

<pre>
[level]
level    = 5
name     = Admin
flags    = *
greeting = Level 5 admin [n] is on the floor
greeting_sound =
</pre>

<p>
If TJW is the connecting admin, all players will see: "Level 5 admin TJW is on the floor".
</p>

<a name="settings"></a><h3>Settings file</h3>
<p>
The settings file is a file that contains all the information about banners and about
killingspree and multikill messages and sounds. See <a href="#g_settings">g_settings</a>
to see how you can enable this file.
</p>
<p>The settings file consists of four types of blocks (similar to <a href="#shrubbot">
shrubbot</a>): [spree], [end], [kill] and [banner]. The [spree] blocks determine what should happen
when someone has a killingspree. The [end] blocks determine what should happen when someone
ends a killingspree and the [kill] blocks do the same for multikills. A [banner] block adds a banner
to the server banner queue.<p>
<p>A [spree] block has the following fields:<pre>
[spree]
number    = 5
message   = [n] ^8is on a killing spree! (^35^8 kills)
position  = chat
display   = all
sound     = sound/misc/killingspree.wav
play      = all
</pre>The "number" determines the amount of kills needed for "message" to be shown and "sound"
to be played. After "position" you can add the location where the "messages" should be displayed.
This can be chat, cpm (popup), cp (center), bp (banner) or print (console). "Display" can have
the values "all" or "player". "All" means the "message" is broadcasted to all players on the server,
and "player" means just to the player who is on the killingspree. "Play" can have the same values
as "display" and the extra value "envi". This value means the "sound" will only be heared by players
in the environment of the player who is on the killingspree.</p>
<p>"Number" has to have a value. When two blocks have the same number, they both get executed at the same time.
 All other fields are optional ("position", "display" and "play" use default values then). <b>[n]</b> in the
"message" will be replaced by the name of the player.</p>
<p>When you set "number" to a negitive integer, you'll create a deathspree.</p>
<p>A [end] block has the following fields:<pre>
[end]
number     = 5
message    = [n]^8's killing spree (^3[k] kills^8) was cut short by ^7[a]^8.
position   = chat
display    = all
sound      = sound/misc/end.wav
play       = all
tkmessage  = [n]^8's killing spree (^3[k] kills^8) was cut short by ^1TEAMMATE ^7[a]^8.
tkposition = chat
tkdisplay  = all
tksound    = sound/misc/end.wav
tkplay     = all
skmessage  = [n]^8's killing spree (^3[k] kills^8) was cut short by ^1himself!
skposition = chat
skdisplay  = all
sksound    = sound/misc/end.wav
skplay     = all
wkmessage  = [n]^8's killing spree (^3[k] kills^8) was cut short.
wkposition = chat
wkdisplay  = all
wksound    = sound/misc/end.wav
wkplay     = all
</pre>The "number" determines the <b>minimum</b> amount of kills needed for "message" to be shown
and "sound" to be played. After "position" you can add the location where the "messages" should be
displayed. This can be chat, cpm (popup), cp (center), bp (banner) or print (console). "Display" can
have the values "all" or "player". "All" means the "message" is broadcasted to all players on the server,
and "player" means just to the player of which the killingspree is ended. "Play" can have the same values
as "display" and the extra value "envi". This value means the "sound" will only be heared by players
in the environment of the player of which the spree is ended.</p>
<p>When a spree is ended, the server uses the [end] block which has the highest "number" which is less
or equal to the amount of kills the player has. If the player is killed by an enemy, the normal fields
are used. If the player is killed by a friend the <b>tk</b> fields are used. A selfkill means <b>sk</b>
fields and a worldkill means <b>wk</b> fields.</p>
<p>"Number" has to have a value. When two blocks have the same number, they both get executed at the same time.
All other fields are optional ("position", "display" and "play" use default values then). <b>[n]</b> in the
"message" will be replaced by the name of the player of which the spree gets ended. <b>[k]</b> will be replaced
by the number of kills and <b>[a]</b> will be replaced by the name of the person who killed the player.</p>
<p>When you set "number" to a negitive integer, you'll create the end of a deathspree. It has no use
setting the tk, sk and wk fieds then, because a deathspree will never be ended that way.<br>Note:
<b>[v]</b> will be replaced by the victim who was killed by the player when a deathspree has ended.</p>
<p>A [kill] block has the following fields:<pre>
[kill]
number     = 2
message    = ^5Double Kill!
position   = chat
display    = player
sound      = sound/misc/doublekill.wav
play       = player
</pre>The "number" determines the amount of kills needed for "message" to be shown and "sound"
to be played. After "position" you can add the location where the "messages" should be displayed.
This can be chat, cpm (popup), cp (center), bp (banner) or print (console). "Display" can have
the values "all" or "player". "All" means the "message" is broadcasted to all players on the server,
and "player" means just to the player who makes the multikill. "Play" can have the same values
as "display" and the extra value "envi". This value means the "sound" will only be heared by players
in the environment of the player who makes the multikill.</p>
<p>"Number" has to have a value. When two blocks have the same number, they both get executed at the same time.
All other fields are optional ("position", "display" and "play" use default values then). <b>[n]</b> in the
"message" will be replaced by the name of the player.</p>
<p>The time between two kills can be changed by changing <a href="#g_multikillTime">g_multikillTime</a>.</p>
<p>A [banner] block has the following fields:<pre>
[banner]
message    = ^1Check out our banner!
wait       = 30
position   = bp
</pre>The "message" is the actual message that is displayed to all the players on the server. The "wait"
field determines when the <b>next</b> banner will be displayed. Setting this to 30 means the next banner
will show up 30 seconds after this banner. Setting the wait to 0 means the next banner will be displayed
at the same moment as this one. This in combination with the "position" field that determines the position
of the banner, allows the same text to be displayed at one time at multiple positions. "position" can have
the values chat, cpm (popup), cp (center), bp (banner) or print (console).</p>

<li>used bani's self-headshot when prone fix
    <a href="http://bani.anime.net/banimod/forums/viewtopic.php?t=3475">
	published in the etpro forum</a>.
<li>used bani's oversize server command fix
    <a href="http://bani.anime.net/banimod/forums/viewtopic.php?t=2706">
	published in the etpro forum</a>.
<li> you can no longer steal a uniform from a corpse that has sunk into the world.
<li> On limited lives servers running dual objective maps, people that join after the timelimit runs out no longer get unlimited lives.
<li>XP shuffle now sorts players by the rate at which they have been gaining XP instead of the total amount of XP they have.
<li>ref commands work in the server console.
<li>shooting breakables (like windows) doesn't count for 'hits' anymore, but shooting wounded players now does.
<li>players are no longer allowed to pick up weapons if they wouldn't be allowed to switch to that weapon in the limbo menu.  (e.g. heavy weapon restrictions or the team_maxWEAPON cvars).
<li>if the time has run out on a dual objective map on a limited lives server, the round will now end if one team runs out of lives even if the objective hasn't been completed.
<li>On limited lives servers running dual objective maps, landmines can be
diffused after the time runs out.
<li><a href="http://et.tjw.org/etpub/hitboxes/">hitboxes</a> are more accurate for several player states. (see g_hitboxes)
<li>if a match is paused and nobody unpauses it, it will start back up again after match_timeoutlength seconds.
<li>on non-limited lives servers, players will no longer have a skull next to
their name after they switch teams.
<li>teams are no longer locked when the warmup countdown starts.
<li>added cp, cpmsay, cpm, chatclient, m, and priv console commands.
<li>akimbo weapons can be reloaded if only one shot has been fired.
<li>when wounded, viewlock should no longer lock on to non-medic teamates.
<li>when following a teammate, you stop following them if they switch to the
    other team.
<li>merged Chruker's bug fixes (<a href="http://games.chruker.dk/enemy_territory/modding_project_bugfix.php">Project: Bug Fix</a>)
<li>ignore and unignore client commands will now accept slot number or
    partial name match.
<li>vsay* commands recognize the ignore list
<li>clients are notified when you add/remove them from your ignore list
<li>when ignoring another client their messages will be visible in the
    console (~), but not chat.
<li>voting for Competition Settings (/callvote comp) makes the server
    try to &quot;exec default_comp.cfg&quot; instead of loading the
    built-in competition settings.
<li>voting for Public Settings (/callvote pub) makes the server try to
    &quot;exec default_pub.cfg&quot; instead of loading the built-in pub
    settings.
<li>voting for Next Map (/callvote nextmap) now loads the next map in
    the campaign instead of loading the next campaign.
<li>added vote_allow_maprestart cvar to control the existing maprestart vote.
    etmain client will still show the button in the menu even if it is
    disabled though.
<li>added <a href="obituaries.html">Custom Obituaries</a>.
