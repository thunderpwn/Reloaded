Important Notes For Upgrading etpub 0.4.x to 0.5.x
--------------------------------------------------

1) If you use g_shove, you may need to lower the value significantly.  The
   value used tries to better match shrubet's so try 80 if you're unsure.

2) If you use the g_logOptions 256 flag or any shrubbot commands that can be
   used to abuse players (e.g. !burn, !disorient, etc.) see the new cvar
   g_tyranny.  You will not be allowed to use any of those features unless
   g_tyranny is set to 1 before the first map is loaded when the server starts.

3) There have been some new votes added and they are allowed by default.
   You can disable them by setting the following cvars to 0:
	vote_allow_surrender
	vote_allow_nextcampaign
	vote_allow_restartcampagin
	vote_allow_poll

4) If you use g_shove, a player emmits a sound when he is shoved.  It is the
   grenade throwing grunt, so if you don't like this set g_shoveSound to ""
   (or to some other sound).

5) g_maxWarp is set to 4 by default now (it was previously disabled by default).

6) Players are no longer allowed to stick their heads into solids.  This will
   produce some gittery movement when they try to do it.  You can avoid this
   by using the etpub_client (as well as use some other new features of etpub)
