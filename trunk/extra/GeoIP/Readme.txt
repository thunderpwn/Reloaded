GeoIP Country Flags
-------------------

The GeoIP.dat file must be in your etpub folder to be able to use this feature.

You can get/update GeoIP.dat from the following URL (don't forget you have to decompress it):

    http://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/GeoLiteCountry/GeoIP.dat.gz

Hint: On linux, you can use the bash script update.sh to periodically update
      the GeoIP database file. Simply copy it to your server's etpub directory
      and give execution permissions to the owner (chmod u+x update.sh).
