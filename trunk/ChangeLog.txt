* included 2 new binary builds (win32 and glibc-2.1).

0.1.7

* "Weapon not available" message is replaced with "{WEAPONNAME} not available"

  on unlimited lives servers.

* added the console commands cp, cpm, cpmsay, qsay, chat, chatclient, m, and
  priv.

  limbo menu because of the client bug.
* chat, chatclient, and cp  commands will recognize "\n" as a newline
  character.

0.2.2
* fixed (I hope) a bug related to my hitbox changes that allows prone players
  to get stuck in walls.
* allow shrubbot commands to be run in the server console without a ! prefixed
  to them.  this allows better shrubet functionality for cmds like cancelvote
  and readconfig.
* fixed (I hope) a race condition that could cause the temporary hitbox
  lowering to be not so temporary and allow players to get stuck in walls
  on revive.

0.2.3
* when using g_mapConfigs, "default.cfg" will now be exec'ed.
* etpub now recognizes permanent bans in shrubbot.cfg although you still
  can't make permanent bans with !ban (need time parameter).

* josh: made several g_antilag fixes.
* josh: censoring now colorcode- and case-insensitive
* josh: antilag fixes for headshots, legshots, and tjw's hitboxes

* tjw: added g_hitboxes cvar (see docs)
* tjw: antilag won't crash the server now.
* josh: bans and kicks work with 2.60. They also give reasons to victims
* josh: double jump added with g_misc 1 (bitflagged). Like shrub.
* josh: /follow will now accept partial matches
* tjw: hitboxes are now used for all traces, not just bullets.  for example,
       you can now fire rifle grenades over teammate's shoulders.
* tjw: extended matt's !slap command to also support !burn.  credit goes
       to dvl drmmr.
* josh: added g_skipCorrection
* michael: added skill_ cvars http://linespeed.net/projects/etpub/ticket/67
* matt: added !lock/unlock (K)
* tjw: added compatability with the 2.60 maps/radar.script
* tjw: added sanity checking to COM_BitSet().  this should prevent a common
       server crash on several custom maps (e.g. glider)
* tjw: prone MG soldiers can no longer shoot people standing on them or on
       their gun
* tjw: prone players are no much easier to stab.  the knife reach has been
       increased and head and leg hitboxes are now knifable.

0.3.2
* josh: fixed censor so it works on more than the last word
* josh: Added g_doubleJumpHeight defaulting to 1.4 to be tunable but feel
        like shrub. g_doubleJumpHeight is a multiplier to the default jump
        velocity. Your second jump velocity will be g_doubleJumpHeight time
        the normal.
* tjw: added checks in COM_BitCheck() and COM_BitClear() to prevent custom
       map related server crashes.
* matt: removed extra newlines from shrubbot AP() output.
* josh: added documentation for the '3' shrubbot flag
* tjw: updated to Tommes's latest German translation of the docs.
* tjw: created a new shrubbot flag for !burn (u).  previously it shared the
       (A) flag with !slap, but some admins may not want to enable both.
* tjw: g_knifeonly should work again.
* josh: Minor fixes to antilag. Shooting player no longer unlagged.
* josh: Body hitboxes are now unlagged when drawn with debugBullets.
* josh: Added antilag debug output from the server
* josh: Added antilag debug output to the client for internal testing only
        This client will also make the server hitboxes blue when g_debugBullets
        is on and it will draw red hitboxes for what the client sees. Output
        is on the console.
* josh: Results of antilag debugging make it look perfect.
* tjw: removed hack that prevented players with lvl 4 light/heavy weapons from
       switching to spec for the first 60 seconds of the map.  this bug has
       been fixed with the 2.60 patch so the hack is no longer neccessary.

0.4.1

* tjw: added g_debugHitboxes cvar
* tjw: adjusted the standing/crouched head hitbox position to better match
       the player model.

       command.  cvars: g_teamdamagerestriction, g_minhits, g_autotempban,
       g_autotempbantime.  client side command /damage
* dvl: !lol command
* josh: reordered antilag lerping to better match the client
* josh: minor fixes to skip correction to better match ET's bg_slidemove.
        This may have fixed the bouncing problem which is caused by
        skip correction.
* matt: partially implemented shrubbot flag 2 (not censored) and flag 9
        (can do shrubbot commands via team and fireteam chat)
* josh: antilag debug info now only prints for the hit entity. Won't print
        anything if it does not hit a player. This happens in the same place
        the hitbox is drawn.
* tjw:  fixed knife and syringe while crouching over wounded player
* tjw:  added !reset and !restart shrubbot commands.
* tjw:  added support for the - and + operators in shrubbot [admin] flags.
* tjw:  added g_voting cvar (see docs)
* tjw:  changed the flag for !burn from 'u' to 'U'.  ('u' is reserved for
        !uptime)
* tjw:  added '6' and '8' shrubbot flags (see docs)
* tjw:  overhauled g_goomba.  you can now goomba with falls that would not
        normally damage you.  you can also do damage to wounded players by
        jumping on them.
* tjw:  corpse dragging now has a bit more pull, so corpses should keep up
        when dragging from crouch.
* tjw:  added g_weapons flag 256 (garands reload)
* tjw:  akimbos will now reload when only 1 shot has been fired.  still reloads
        both though.
* matt: added g_skills flag 1, ability to spot landmines for teammates if you
        have level 4 battlesense
* tjw:  added g_moverScale cvar (see docs)

* dvl:  added !pip/!pop
* matt: added mute status to !listplayers, red M is shown if player is muted
        else, empty space
* matt: changed !pause/unpause from z to Z, as !pip/!pop are z in shrub
* dvl:  updated !pip/pop, !lol now accepts parameter for number of nades
        !lol/!pop/!pip with no param does everyone
	!lol -1 X does X nades around everyone
* dvl:  g_slashKill partially implemented, only flag 8, disabling /kill
* matt: added a primitive shake to poison needles
* tjw:  added g_ammoCabinetTime and g_healthCabinetTime cvars (see docs)
* tjw:  viewlock when wounded should no longer follow non-medics occasionally.
* tjw:  XPSave should work for stopwatch gametypes now.
* tjw:  ATB will not act during intermission anymore.

* tjw:  changed output of !admintest to better match shrubet
* matt: added g_logOptions 256, to log private messages
* tjw:  added g_spectator cvar (see docs)
* tjw:  fixed bug that let you keep following a teammate when he switched
        teams.
* josh: Added bitflag 8 to g_censorPenalty which auto-mutes a player for
        g_censorMuteTime [60] seconds.
* josh: Fixed unlagged skip correction. The bouncing is gone now. It was
        caused by the velocity never being copied over in the original
        ET code. So velocity was always very very wrong. g_skipCorrection 1
        should work VERY nicely now.
* tjw:  fixed head hitbox position for moving animations
* tjw:  increased the crouch hitbox adjustment because the moving animation
        is taller than the idle one.
* matt: added g_medics CVAR, controlling various aspects of the medic
        added support for changing regeneration rate of the medic
* josh: You can now use /follow to follow teammates when in limbo.
* josh: Added g_truePing(0|1). Will calculate ping as the time between the
        current time and the client's last command time stamp.
* tjw:  added g_maxWarp cvar (see docs)
* tjw:  added g_dropObj cvar (see docs)
* tjw:  fixed a custom map related scripting segfault:
        http://linespeed.net/projects/etpub/ticket/192

        displayed twice in the +scores
* tjw:  fixed satchel auto-switch problem with 2.60

* tjw:  added clearxp server console command.
* matt: g_medics additions, medics can't self heal, can't heal self of poison
* matt: removed ability to playdead when poisoned, ticket 191.  Potential fix
        for using mobile MG or mounted MG to stop poison jitter effect
* matt: added fling/launch/throw shrubbot commands
* matt: fixed !slap bug that would revive if player was dead but not gibbed

0.4.2
* tjw: match_readypercent will now only be used for the ready percent in
       warmup (like before).  g_intermissionReadyPercent will be used for
       ready percent during intermission.
* tjw: removed Players_Axis and Players_Allies from the server info string.
       it turns out some admins do use up all of the extra space with 'sets'.
       (e.g. .URL .IRC .FavoriteColor .ICQ .AstrologicalSign, etc.)
* tjw: fixed (hopefully) a bug I introduced into G_SendScores() that caused
       +scores to pop up seemingly randomly on servers with lots of players.
       This can also cause client crashes.
* tjw: MAX_SHRUBBOT_FLAGS increased from 32 to 64
* tjw: MAX_SHURBBOT_ADMINS increased from 1024 to 32768
* tjw: g_antilag was only working half the time.  I didn't understand
       how EF_TELEPORT_BIT was used.  it's not set when the player
       teleports, but rather toggled and the client looks for a change
       between client frames.
* tjw: non-soldier players with level 4 heavy weapons skill can now
       pickup and use enemy SMG's.

0.4.3
* matt: Poison Needle kills now count as 3XP toward first aid skills
* tjw:  removed correction on hitboxes for players in the tank.  2.60
        fixed this, so it's no longer necessary.
* tjw:  fixed tank MG overheating too fast.
* tjw:  fixed "FLAMETHOWER not available" message spamming when using
        team_maxFlamers.
* tjw:  added g_serverInfo cvar (see docs)
* tjw:  fixed a bug that caused spectators to follow the next player as
        soon as ANYONE died unless the g_spectator 4 flag was set.
* tjw:  shrubbot commands will now be ignored if g_shrubbot is set to "".
        (for better etadmin_mod compatiblity).
* tjw:  fixed the playdead on medkit bug.
* tjw:  fixed a problem that caused incomplete scoreboards on servers with
        high numbers of players.
* tjw:  g_skipCorrection should work better now on servers with g_antilag
        disabled.
* tjw:  g_skipCorrection should work better now when the player is on a
        ladder.
* tjw:  calling !mute on a muted player will no longer unmute them.  calling
        !unmute on a player who is not muted will no longer mute them.
* tjw:  fixed problem with holding +attack while hitting jump as spectator.

0.4.4
* josh: Silenced akimbos are really silenced (thanks Azyu)
* josh: Mutes persist across maps. auto_mute_time wasn't being saved, is now
* tjw:  I'm a hypocrite and added yet another cvar in a bug fix release.
        It's g_goombaFlags (see docs).  Many people do not like goomba doing
        damage to teamates.  I will add more functionality to this cvar in
        0.5.1.
* josh: skip corrected entities are linked now so it will be harder to skip
        over mines and players dropping packets will be more hittable if
        antilag is not on.
* tjw:  when using g_dropObj, players must switch to knife before they can
        drop the objective.
* tjw:  !reset and !restart will now work during intermission.
* tjw:  fixed another problem with the scoreboard when there are over 32
        players on a server.
* tjw:  soldiers can again choose between pistol, akimbo, or mp40 when
        they have level 4 heavy weapon skills.
* tjw:  intermission countdown will now draw correctly for the client
        if g_intermissionTime is set to something other than 60.
        (thanks jaybird)

0.5.1
* matt: !listteams shrubbot command added
* dvl:  g_logOptions 512 added, to log real time instead of server up time
* azyu: g_weapons options 8,16 added, half/full restore of charge bar if
        airstrike aborted
* matt: poisoned players gurgle.  medics who caused the poisoning receiving
        notification via a cp
* matt: g_slashkill option 16 added, can't /kill when you are poisoned
* matt: implemented azyu's patch for /kill functionality.  implements 1,2
        flags, flag 4 doesn't work quite right
* matt: added g_axisSpawnInvul, g_alliedSpawnInvul
* josh: g_censorPenalty 2 flag now works. People with censored words in their
        names will be kicked before they begin. If g_censorNames is not "",
        censored words in names will be *'d and uncolored.
* josh: g_logOptions 1 flag will print obituaries in chat instead of cpm.
        Uses extra bandwidth.
* josh: Poison and Goomba kills have new obituaries.
* josh: g_logOptions 1024 will print obits faster from server. Uses more
        bandwidth like g_logOptions 1. 1 will override 1024 so if you use
        both you'll get obituaries in chat.
* josh: g_killRating 1 added as default. Uses a probabilistic measure of a
        players killing ability. Rating is based on how hard each kill is and
        which weapon was used. See docs. /killrating shows your ratings.
* josh: if g_killRating is 1, shuffle will use overall kill ratings.
* josh: overall kill rating is included in XP save.
* josh: Fixed a small spawn point bug I had made.
* tjw:  added windows installer
* tjw:  added mac installer
* tjw:  used new PM_TraceAll() from 2.60 in playdead checking
* tjw:  improved PM_TraceAll() related checking to test for players heads
        and legs instead of just legs.  This should prevent player models
        from sticking through doors when prone or dead next to them.
* tjw:  added g_goombaFlags 2, 4, 8, and 16 (see docs)
* josh: Added g_killRating flags 1,2,4, and 8 (see docs). Default is 7 for
        testing purposes (0.5.0). Feel free to change the default for 0.5.1.
* matt: added !passvote shrubbot command
* tjw:  added g_shoveNoZ and g_shoveSound cvars (see docs)
* tjw:  UPGRADE NOTE the value used for g_shove is significatly different
        in this version of etpub.  It should be much closer to the shrubet
        value, so lower values pack more punch.  80 is recommended.
* tjw:  added g_ATB_swap and g_ATB_rating cvars (see docs)
* tjw:  added 4 flag to g_serverInfo (see docs)
* matt: added 8 flag to g_serverInfo
* tjw:  added g_stats cvar (see docs)
* matt: added 2048 g_logOptions option (see docs)

* tjw:  reformatted output of !showbans
* tjw:  added g_tyranny (see docs)
* tjw:  improved shrubbot documentation in docs/index.html
* tjw:  removed *ChargeTime cvars from the serverInfo string by default
        to save space.  These can be added back with the 16 flag to
        g_serverInfo (see docs)
* tjw:  when using g_serverInfo flags 1, 2, 4, or 8 the server will populate
        the relevant cvars with "." characters to their maximum length
	initially.  This will prevent "Info string length exceeded" crashes
	from occurring mid-game if the admin has added too many 'sets'
	cvars to support the g_serverInfo flag.  (The crash will instead
	happen when the server starts.)
* tjw:  /ignore and /unignore commands now accept slot# or partial
        name match
* tjw:  /unignore command now prints out all ignored clients if no
        name or slot# is given.
* tjw:  /m now recognizes the ignore list
* tjw:  /vsay, /vsay_buddy, and /vsay_team now recognize the ignore list.
* tjw:  /say, /say_team, and /say_buddy messages from clients who you
        are ignoring will now print to your client console (not chat)
        instead of dropping them altogether.
* tjw:  when you use add or remove someone from your ignore list with
        /ignore or /unignore, they are notified.
* tjw:  !showbans now only prints out 30 bans at a time and accepts
        a parameter (number to skip).
* tjw:  doors will open silently when crouching (etpro thing I guess).
* tjw:  added cvar g_mapScriptDirectory (see docs)
* tjw:  added preliminary support for etpromapscripts.
* tjw:  changed default for g_maxWarp to 4.  I also increased the number
        of frames that g_skipCorrection will act on from 2 to 3.
* tjw:  !showbans X supports negative number to show the last X bans in
        the list.
* tjw:  added !disorient and !orient shrubbot commands.
* tjw:  /killrating now prints out a sorted list of all player's killratings
        similar to the /players command.  the list is only printed to
        the client that runs the command.
* tjw:  added g_campaignFile cvar (see docs)
* tjw:  fixed possible covert ops weapon issue with g_classChange
* tjw:  added 'forcecvar' server command.  this will of course only work
        if using the client mod.  unmodified clients will see the message
        "Unknown client game command: forcecvar".
* tjw:  improved etpromapscripts compatibility.  need client mod in order
        to see "You are near the Back Door" popup.
* tjw:  added g_fightSound cvar (see docs)
* tjw:  client mod won't draw the wounded message when playing dead.
* tjw:  client mod won't predict EV_NOFIRE_UNDERWATER.  this means if
        you're using g_weapons 2 or 4 flags, you won't hear clicking
	when using syringe or pliers underwater.
* tjw:  removed +lookup, -lookup, +lookdown, and -lookdown commands from the
        client mod.  these are used for anti-recoil cheats.
* tjw:  added !resetxp shrubbot command (see docs)
* tjw:  added 'playsound' server command.
* tjw:  added "/callvote surrender" and cvar vote_allow_surrender
* tjw:  added "/callvote restartcampaign" and cvar vote_allow_restartcampaign
* tjw:  added "/callvote nextcampaign" and cvar vote_allow_nextcampaign
* tjw:  added "/callvote poll" and cvar vote_allow_poll
* tjw:  "/callvote nextmap" now loads the next map in the campaign instead
        of loading the next campaign (when in campaign mode).
* tjw:  "/callvote comp" now tries to "exec default_comp.cfg" instead of
        loading the built-in competition settings.
* tjw:  "/callvote pub" now tries to "exec default_pub.cfg" instead of
        loading the built-in public settings.
* tjw:  increased the range for shoving slightly to be more like shrubet.
        it should be a lot easier to shove other players while you're
        both moving now.
* tjw:  added cvar g_fear (see docs)
* tjw:  corpses can now be destroyed with satchel or dyno again.
        (bug introduced by the 2.60 patch)
* tjw:  fixed a couple of issues with inappropriate "spread scale" increases.
* matt: added basic banner support, g_msgs, g_msgpos, g_msgX (see docs)
* tjw:  g_slashKill 4 flag now restores the charge bar to the same state
        it was in at the moment the player issued /kill (regardless of how
	long they were in limbo).
* tjw:  tank mg will now consider the incline the tank is on when limiting
        the pitch restriction again (oops).
* tjw:  added g_obituary cvar and removed g_logOptions flag 1024 (see docs)
* tjw:  etpub_client now tries very hard not to save any of the forcecvar
        cvars in the profile etconfig.cfg file.  also, once forcecvar is
        used to set a client cvar, the client can no longer modify it
	(until they restart their client).
* tjw:  forcecvar remembers all forced cvars for the current map and sends
        them to connecting clients.


0.5.2
* tjw:  !resetxp from the server console was causing a segfault.
* tjw:  g_serverInfo 4 flag was only working for the first map in the
        campaign.
* tjw:  players who are dead or playing dead can no longer shove other
        players.
* tjw:  added vote_allow_maprestart cvar.  the button will still appear
        in the MISC vote menu unless using the upcoming etpub_client.
* tjw:  players can no longer /playdead with a ticking grenade or a
        spinning up panzer.
* tjw:  forcevar commands will be issued to the client when they've finished
        connecting instead of when they start connecting.  this was causing
	problems on (at least) servers without warmup because the map config
	containing the forcecvar commands hadn't been executed yet.
* tjw:  fixed (hopefully) a bug that was preventing most g_slashKill options
        from working.
* tjw:  !showbans was not accepting it's parameter when it was issued
        with "say".
* tjw:  you can now use /m to send private messages to yourself.  this
        is for etadmin_mod compatability.
* tjw:  g_shoveSound and g_poisonSound now use EV_GENERAL_SOUND instead
        of EV_GLOBAL_SOUND so you won't hear them so far way from the
	player emitting the sound.
* tjw:  prevented sending duplicate forcecvar commands to the client when
        those commands are issued at the very start of a map (e.g. g_mapConfigs)


0.5.3
* tjw:   fixed !showbans crash bug


0.6.1
* forty: fix for bug that breaks autoreload occasionally
* forty: added min_airstriketime and min_artytime cvars
* forty: added g_weapons 512 flag (garand/k43 equality)
* josh: censor autogib will work with /kill on now
* forty: added cvar g_constructibleXPSharing
* forty: fixed team_maxGrenLaunchers for axis team (wasn't working)
* forty: added cvar g_asblock
* matt:  fixed !throw to throw in direction player is facing instead
         of north/south (Thanks KillerWhale)
* forty: XP Saver now preserves a players mute state to prevent reconnecting
         to undo a mute.
* matt:  added g_weapons option 64 for binoc dropping and g_misc option 2
         for binoc master competition.  NOTE: to display binoc model
         correctly, client-side file weapons/binocs.weap must be downloaded
         to client
* matt:  Courtesy of bacon's code in SD forums, added throwing knives (see docs)
         NOTE: to display knife model correctly, client-side file
         weapons/knife.weap must be downloaded to client
* matt:  fixed shrubbot flag 1, so admins with flag 1 set can't be vote muted
* forty: subversion lines endings are now always windows native
* forty: Zinx's b_realhead code
* forty: bugfix for b_realhead with antilag
* forty: fix some vc++ compile errors
* forty: sudden death dynamite
* matt:  fixed a few throwing knives bugs, throwing knive kills now give
         3 light weapons XP
* gabriel: added party panzers
* forty: fix realhead related corpse headbox problems and reenabled waiting
	 for medic animation when b_realhead is enabled.
* forty: dynamite chaining
* forty: XP Save now preserves team_hits and hits to prevent teambleeders/griefs from
         reconnecting to dodge team damage restriction kicks.
* forty: #339 - Limbo'd and Spectators can throw knives fix
* forty: #208 - can always obscure field ops canisters.
	 Added bit to g_asblock to prevent lvl 3 and higher fdops from having their
	 airstrikes blocked by players.
* forty: some documentation updates as well.
* forty: #84 - Added canister kicking.
* forty: fixed bugs with canister kicking, and one more I missed with dead
	 but following knife throwing
* forty: g_canisterKick added to the documentation.
* forty: #129 - Added 2 - adrenaline counter and options 4 - Disable the tap-out
	 confirmation dialog box, 8 - Display connection attempts by banned players,
	 and 32 - Omit "Item" lines from logfile.
* forty: disarming a teammates satchel no longer gives you xp.
* forty: #24 - playdeads no longer hold weapons. Also fixes the flame thrower fire drawing
	 clientside while holding down fire and playing dead.
* forty: #126 - Added 16 - report gibs
* forty: fix for dead but not gibbed can capture flags
* forty: fix for setlevel privilege escalation - players with s flag can set themselves and
	 and others to levels higher than themselves
* forty: Increased the number of xp savers slots. Xp saver now saves information before map
	 changes, so people dropped during warmup and map changes don't lose xp. Xp saver
	 is now more selective about which slot it will save into, It will try to overwrite
	 your own data first, then use the first free slot if available, then use the oldest
	 stored data. It also will clean it self up when appropriate, removing stale data.
* forty: Fix for fireteam crash.
* forty: Fix for switching team multiple times grants instant respawn.
* matt:  Fix for team damage kick/rejoin/kick vicious cycle bug introduced by
         changeset: 603
* matt:  Added !swap shrubbot command
* tjw:   http://linespeed.net/projects/etpub/ticket/359 used PerroGrande's fix
         for the velcro grenade problem that showed up with kickable objects.
* matt:  Added !nextmap shrubbot command
* matt:  Added two new g_medics flags.  16 = no akimbos, 32 = pistol only
* tjw:   Added ent->client->pers.etpubc which is an integer representing
         the version of the connected client (if it's etpub).  This can
         be useful for enabling certain behaviours only if the client's
         client supports it.
* tjw:   committed PerroGrande's patch for custom obituaries.
         http://linespeed.net/projects/etpub/ticket/364
* tjw:   committed PerroGrande's patch for g_killingspree
         http://linespeed.net/projects/etpub/ticket/368
* matt:  committed PerroGrande's updated patch for killing spree
         streak messages
* tjw:   committed PerroGrande's tunable-weapon-damage patches
         http://linespeed.net/projects/etpub/ticket/372
* tjw:   disabled g_dropAmmo/g_dropHealth during warmup
         http://linespeed.net/projects/etpub/ticket/374
* tjw:   referee's can no longer be complained against
         http://linespeed.net/projects/etpub/ticket/362
* tjw:   added g_cmdTimeRestriction cvar (see docs)
         http://linespeed.net/projects/etpub/ticket/374
* matt:  added team_maxMedics, Engineers, FieldOps and CovertOps
         for limiting classes, based on Azyu's sample code on SD forums
* tjw:   players can no longer /playdead when they have a view changing
         weapon like a scope or a set heavy weapon.
* perro: added g_staminaRecharge which can be used to tweak the rate at which
         players rebuild stamina.  Implemented g_misc 16 which disables jumping
         when stamina falls below approx 17%.  Client update required for these
         to be effective.
         http://linespeed.net/projects/etpub/ticket/355
* tjw:   copied etpubc storage from client->pers to client->pmext so it can be
         used in pmove.
* tjw:   removed my overzealous version detection for PM_JUMP_STAMINA :)
* tjw:   added g_misc 32 flag (see docs)
* tjw:   improved version detection through the use of the ConfigString
         CS_ETPUBINFO.  In order to protect the already crowded
         CS_SERVERINFO configstring, add cvars to this instead of using
         CVAR_SERVERINFO.  To do this you will need to add your cvar to
         G_IsEtpubinfoCvar() and G_UpdateEtpubinfo() in g_main.c and also
         to CG_ParseEtpubinfo() in cg_servercmds.c.  I've already done
         this with g_misc, g_doubleJumpHeight, and g_staminaRecharge.
* tjw:   renamed cvar min_airstriketime to g_minAirstrikeTime
* tjw:   renamed cvar min_artytime to g_minArtyTime
* tjw:   renamed cvar b_realhead to g_realHead, also made it default to 1
* tjw:   removed g_cmdTimeRestriction.  The normal behaviour of the client
         is to throw various commands at the server in fast succession.
	    It was becoming very hackish allowing some commands to come in fast
	    and some not.  I think it's best to just trust the game engine's
	    built in rate limiting.  (a.k.a if it ain't broke don't fix it).
* perro: changed g_staminarecharge to be a floating point multiplier rather than
	 an offset.
* matt:  Fixed typo in team_max checks
* tjw:   File-based XPSave replacing cvar based XPSave.  This adds two new
         cvars: g_XPSaveFile and g_XPSaveMaxAge.  Up to 32768 records can
         be saved.  If you're running with the g_XPSave 4 flag, you will
         probably want to tune g_XPSaveMaxAge (default is 1 week).
* perro: Initial G_Damage code re-work to allow for Shrub-style "reflecting damage".
	 Removed hardwired "headshot = 50".  Replaced with g_dmgHeadShot cvar that can
	 work in conjunction with tunable weapons.
	 Removed "nade-boosting" exploit that was present when FF was off.
	 Removed blocks of code that had been commented-out to make G_Damage
	 easier to read and understand.
	 Added g_dmg cvar which will be used in some more optional G_Damage
	 features/changes that I'm working on.
* matt:  updated team_max checks so that it now also checks when initially
         joining a team instead of only when switching classes within same
         team
* perro: Added g_reflectfriendlyfire [float] cvar that allows admin to set
	 whether friendly fire reflects back to the player who did the damage.
	 Acts as a multiplier to damage.
* perro: Added #defines for future use with g_dmg cvar
* perro: Added code to handle three experimental g_dmg settings
	 Removed unnecessary floating-point computations in g_weapon.c
* perro: Added g_killingSpreePos cvar to control where killing spree messages
	 are displayed on the screen.
* tjw:   cleaned up kill spree code.
* perro: turned off reflecting damage for landmines.
* tjw:   fixed a bug with new xpsave and limited lives
* tjw:   hopefully fixed the bug that keeps XPSave from loading stored XP
         if cl_guid has not been set yet at the time of initial connect.
* perro: remove anti-landmine hack from reflecting damage.
	   replaced with a bitmask cvar that allows admins to select which
	   categories of weapons will reflect.
* perro: updated commented server.cfg to show g_reflectFFWeapons bitmask values.
* perro: actually removed the anti-landmine hack this time...
* perro: added three new g_dmg bitmasks, tweaked g_dmg 4 downward for balance.
* tjw:   created a new cvar g_coverts and moved g_dmg 64 flag to g_coverts 1
* perro: fixed small typo
* perro: corrected minor problem introduced by consolidating killing spree
         into one function.  It was creating sprees where sprees should not
         have been (a suicide, for example, created a one-kill spree).
         Corrected this problem and prevented /kill and team switch from
         ending sprees and creating death sprees.
* perro: updated killing spree code to allow customizable messages.  Docs to
         follow.
* perro: Implemented g_dmgFlamer.
         Removed brain-damaged g_dmg 8 function and replaced with tjw's
         g_dmgHeadShotRatio suggestion.
         Re-named g_dmgHeadshot to g_dmgHeadShotMin for clarity.
* tjw:   Q_StrReplace() is now easier to use
* tjw:   Added [a] for g_killingSpreeMsg_end and g_killingSpreeMsg_tk
* perro: Changed custom obits to take advantage of new parsing capabilities.
	 Updated docs accordingly.
* perro: Fixed uniform stealing bug.  Covies can no longer steal opposition
	 uniforms by stealing unis from covies on their own team.
	 Added check for BODY_TEAM(ent) > 2
* gabriel: Fixed buggy party panzers, now they fire correctly in all directions.
* perro: Fixed Medic-with-Panzer bug.
* gabriel: Added g_panzersVulnerable and g_panzersGravity.  Renamed
	 g_partyPanzersSpeed to g_panzersSpeed and the setting now applies to
	 both normal and party panzers.
* perro: admins can now define any level of killing spree "levels" that they want
	 undefined levels will use g_killingspreed_default as the message.
* perro: added g_medics 64 bitflag to provide an alternative to medic tk/revive
	 this option allows medics to use syringes, under certain conditions,
	 to provide healing to living teammates.
* perro: killing sprees were counting tk's toward killing spree
	 added OnSameTeam() check to prevent this
* perro: reflected friendlyfire was insta-gibbing players if they took
	 enough damage to die. Fixed.
* tjw:   dropped NO_FPHEX #ifdef in favor of always using the
         non floating point hex notation for Zinx's realhead code.  This
         was done for compiler compatability only.
* tjw:   replaced g_XPSaveMaxAge with three seperate cvars:
         g_XPSaveMaxAge_xp
         g_XPSaveMaxAge_mute
         g_XPSaveMaxAge_killrating
         These control how long to keep each these three various long
         term storage values.
* tjw:   changed default for g_ATB_rating to 3 (use killRating)
* tjw:   changed color for default kill spree messages to ^8
         to be consistent and neutral of other meaningful chat colors.
* tjw:   added g_shortcuts cvar (see docs)
* tjw:   fixed a bug that caused !unmute to fail for someone who was
         muted by XPSave.
* tjw:   added classnames to all gentities to make debugging G_Spawn()
         crashes easier.
* tjw:   restricted weapon fire when the game engine starts running out of
	 game entities to prevent "G_Spawn: no free entities" crashes.
* tjw:   prevented MatchToken crashes when parsing badly formatted
         g_shrubbot or g_XPSaveFile files.
* perro: Added new g_weapons bitmask (1024).
	 This optional bitmask places a hitbox around mortar rounds.
	 When this bit is set, "horizontal mortaring" through windows
	 and slits becomes very difficult, or impossible, depending on
	 the size of the opening.
* tjw:   XPSave will now only write relevant data to the file to keep the
         file size and parsing time down.  Also fixed a but that allowed
         players to reset their killrating by disconnecting when their score
         was 0xp.
* perro: Added cvars and code to allow separate tuning of damage and damage
	 radius for exploding weapons (including panzers which were previously
	 hardwired).  Fixed incorrect handling of tunable landmine damage.
	 MAP_MORTAR will return traditional damage value (250) instead of
	 incorrectly matching tunable grenade launcher damage.
	 Docs to follow for new cvars.
* tjw:   made gentities checking more strict (fun_beach causing "G_Spawn:
         no free entities" crash)
* tjw:   imported g_weapons, g_medics, and g_coverts into client space to
         aid in prediction and add new future features.
* tjw:   I may have fixed the multiple helmet bug caused by g_weapons 32
* tjw:   clearxp should now work for connecting clients who were given XP
         by XPSave as well.
* josh: Added g_playerRating and most of its implementation. This will track
        how valuable a player is based on how even that player wins against
        teams that are good. It can be used to shuffle and for ATB as well.
        player rating shuffle will override kill rating shuffle. player rating
        will only be calculated if g_playerRating_minplayers have played in
        the map.
* josh: Made it so ATB by kill rating works as long as any kill rating options
        are enabled, since it will be calculated.
* tjw:   added g_shuffle_rating cvar (see docs)
* tjw:   g_XPSaveMaxAge has been re-added.  It will be used in place of
         g_XPSaveMaxAge_killrating and g_XPSaveMaxAge_mute and the default
         maximum age for all things [xpsave] stores.
* tjw:   added [mapstat] element to the xpsave.cfg file so map w/l ratio will
         be available to playerRating.
* tjw:   xpsave will only update [mapstat] records if there are
         g_playerRating_minplayers clients are playing.
* josh:  Player rating now takes the current map into account
* josh:  Moved player rating to LogExit so it's calculated before the message
* josh:  added g_teamForceBalance_playerrating: only allows a disparity of two
         standard deviations between team ratings (200 rating points).
* perro: Fixed some minor problems with reflected fire.  With ff-off, shooting at
	 limbo'ed teammates does not damage you.  Added new MOD to support
	 reflected FF.
* tjw:   implemented g_coverts 2 and 4 flags (see docs)
* forty: sigsegv stack traces on Linux.
* forty: updated vcproj files to include g_crash.c,cg_hud.c,g_xpsave.c/h
* perro: added g_friendlyFireOpts cvar.
	 g_friendlyFireOpts can be used to change the behavior of certain
	 friendly fire events.
* perro: added g_friendlyfireOpts bitmask to prevent teammates (other than engies)
	 from even triggering landmines from their teammates
* tjw:   added shufflenorestart vote and vote_allow_shufflenorestart cvar.
* perro: minor change to the VS project file so that MS Visual Studio
	 isn't quite so whiney during compile
* tjw:   turned of g_enforcemaxlives by default.  it uses IP bans and xpsave
         can be used instead to keep track of lives between connects.
* tjw:   added readxp and writexp server console commands.  readxp is
         g_tyranny protected.
* josh:  Added ratingsinfo server command.
* josh:  Fixed a bug in g_teamForceBalance_playerrating. Now it will not allow
         any player to join a team with a > 75% chance of winning in general.
* perro: Added cvars to allow tuning of damage and damage radius for artillery
	   and airstrikes.  Docs to follow.
* tjw:   added name parameter to [xpsave] element in xpsave.cfg format.
* josh:  made g_teamForceBalance_playerrating override
         g_teamForceBalance to prevent teamjoin deadlocks.
* gabriel: Added g_medics flag 128: disable medic health regeneration
* perro: added optional g_dmg 8 bitmask which includes a simple
	 bullet falloff computation based on weapon type and characteristics.
	 Adjusted spread for FG42 when g_dmg 32 is set.
* gabriel: Separated medic health regenerate rate adjustment into its own setting,
	 g_medicHealthRegen, took out the regeneration rate values from g_medics,
	 and added a couple more options for the sake of completeness.
* josh:  Changed favored team max probability on adaptive balancing to 70%.
* josh:  Mixed the map and playerrating probabilities in a more stable and
         readable way.
* josh:  Added team ratings info to the end of !listteams.
* tjw:   added g_XPDecay and g_XPDecayRate cvars (see docs)
* perro: Added experimental damage-based XP.  Added two cvars to support this:
	 g_dmgXP and g_dmgXPLevel (see docs).
* perro: reduced some of the minimums and defaults for damage-based xp.
* josh:  modified winning probability to sum to one
* tjw:   fixed g_XPDecay so that it will decay past the set skillPoints for
         each level-up.  Note that this currently makes the scripting play
         the "Congratulations on your promotion [Rank]" when the player is
         actually being demoted which is kind of funny, but should probably
         be turned off if possible.
* perro: added et-pro-style damage XP option.  Changed cvars from
	 g_dmgXP and g_dmgXPLevel to:
	 g_damageXP and g_damageXPLevel
* tjw:   added g_XPDecayFloor cvar (see docs)
* tjw:   added g_XPDecay 32 flag (see docs)
* tjw;   writexp command will now update the xpsave information of all of
         currently connected players.
* tjw:   added !resetmyxp shrubbot command.  Also fixed the !resetxp command
         so that it didn't allow players to keep their skill points, rank,
         and level specific weapons.
* tjw:   added g_maxXP cvar (see docs)
* josh:  Changed g_activeTeamBalance to g_ATB_diff, and added g_ATB
         (see docs)
* josh:  Added g_ATB 2 which uses playerrating to balance teams. Seems to
         work well so far.
* tjw:   rewrote g_dyno 1 so that checking for sudden death overtime is done
         with the actualy scripting engine.  this is probably buggy but it
         works on battery anyway.
* tjw:   implemented a workaround for mapscripts such as fueldump's that
         incorrectly put a "wait" before "wm_endround".  This was causing
         the timelimit to be hit if the objective exploded in sudden death
         incorrectly giving the defending team victory.
* matt:  added team lock status to !listteams
* josh:  g_ATB 2 now allows swapping with g_ATB_swap. Also, skill level in
         player rating is now twice as important as map difficulty.
* tjw:   may have fixed a g_shortcuts crash related to players having
         shortcuts in their name.
* tjw:   improved the "team" command so that it bails out if the selected
         class or weapon are not available due to the team_max______ cvars.
         also it will use latched weapons if no weapons were provided as
         parameters.
* perro: adjusted g_damageXP 1 settings to grant damage XP for kill shots, too.
	   cleaned-up the damageXP code.
	   fixed typo in g_main.c that was preventing linking
* josh:  Fixed a min players playerrating bug and added sanity checking to
         mapPad. g_playerRating_mapPad allows you to add wins to the maps to
         stabilize the means early on.
* forty: modernized the linux stack trace code, handles more errors (SIGILL,
         SIGFPE, SIGBUS)
* perro: fixed crash bug with G_DamageXP set and clients falling to their death.
         also fixed several other non-reported bugs with G_DamageXP
* kw:    bugfix: players could get in a tank while looking through a sniper scope.
* kw:    most servercommands now work on non-dedicated servers too.
* tjw:   added some glibc #ifdefs for glibc 2.1.3 compatability in g_crash.c
* tjw:   added skill_weight and map_weight to [mapstat] in xpsave file
* kw:    bugfix: "Reloading" the knife let you lose all your knives.
         bugfix: double attack sounds when throwing knives was off or empty clip.
         bugfix: throwing knives didn't play the correct sound.
* josh:  bugfix: Map padding sanity check resulted in garbage for map pad
* josh:  map padding now falls off as it is replaced with real matches.
* josh:  map padding defaults to 50 per team. Disappears after 100 games.
* josh:  skill and map weights now start and 0.5 and adapt. Changed to start
         at 0.5 since the map padding will ofset any early imbalance.
* josh:  "cleaned up" ratings code. made ratings updates more accurate.
* tjw:   g_teamForceBalance_playerrating no longer requires g_teamForceBalance
         to be enabled (which it overrides anyway).
* josh:  Increased player award to reflect the new attenuation. Increased
         weight update learning rate to adapt fast. The weight update LR
         doesn't really matter in this case. Too high or too low will make
         it adapt slower, but not incorrectly.
* perro: reduced size of hitboxes on kickables to further reduce "velcro" effect
	 hitboxes are now only drawn if the kickables cvar is actually non-zero
* tjw:   g_ATB 2 will now warn players they are about to be moved 10 seconds
         before the switch.
* tjw:   ATB will not switch players who have a disguise or who are carrying
         an objective
* tjw:   ATB will not switch any players if any team has two players who are
         out of lives on limited lives servers.
* perro: prevented arty/air/grenade/etc damage from players who have disconnected
	 or dropped to spec. mode.

* tjw:   ATB will not switch any players if there's a dynamite plant ticking
         that could end the game.
* tjw:   added 64 and 128 flags to g_XPDecay (see docs)
* tjw:   I added the raw netname to shrubbot.cfg and xpsave.cfg instead of
         the "Sanitized" version.  This has been requested by those who
         wish to see colors and case in their parsing scripts.  Also fixed
         a bug with !listplayers that could screw up columns if a level
         name had non alphanumerics in it.
* tjw:   ATB will not switch any players if there are less than 5 mins left
         in the match.
* josh:  Changed my mind about some parts of the ratings for now. Needs more
         work to take it to that level. Things scale as before now.
* perro: added g_coverts 8 which causes disguised covies to take half damage
* perro: added g_coverts 16 which causes disguised covies to be immune to
         splash damage.
* perro: added g_coverts 64 which covers non-silenced weapons
         cleaned-up the "lose your uniform" code
* tjw:   g_coverts 32 will now allow coverts to keep their disguise even
         if an enemy sees them firing a weapon.
* tjw:   added g_coverts 128 flag that allows disguised coverts to hop on
         emplaced guns without losing uniforms.  firing emplaced weapons
         will still lose uniforms unless the 64 flag is set.  Also, because
         of client side prediction, it will look like the uniform is lost
         to the client until they detatch from the gun.
* tjw:   fixed flickering health bar bug when looking at disguised coverts.
* tjw:   added csinfo and csdump console commands for debugging the
         MAX_GAMESTATE_CHARS client crash.  Also added overflow protection
         which might be more trouble than it's worth.
* tjw:   I'm pretty sure I've tracked the MAX_GAMESTATE_CHARS client crashes
         to the the initial population of SERVERINFO cvars that I added
         to prevent a server crash mid-game on servers with lots of "sets"
         cvars).  I replaced this populating with checking.
* josh:  Changed default g_teamForceBalance_playerrating to 0 and recommended
         60. People probably shouldn't start with this on.
* josh:  bugfix: Changed PMF_DOUBLEJUMPING bitflag from 65536 to 128 since
         only 16-bits are sent over to the client. This fixes a client bug,
         since it is in bg, but is compiled into the server as well. Thanks
         to Zozz for finding this.

0.6.2
* gabriel: Fixed [t] shortcut for throwing knives: [t] was expanding to knives
           plus max knives.  Now it just returns the knives in player possession.
* tjw:     fix for "player flicker" related to having a large number of
           custom pk3 files on the server.


0.6.3
* tjw:     "csdump 1" command will now print the full string instead of just the
           first 1024 characters.
* tjw:     GAMESTATE size tracking now correctly accounts for '\0' for each CS
           and correctly tracks the size of CS_SYSTEMINFO.  Thanks AK.Waters.
* tjw:     fix for g_skipCorrection/PM_TraceLegs crash
* josh:    bugfix: end-of-game top overall killer was wrong, it's right now.
* josh:    rebalanced team sizes so that 1.5 vs. 1 is a blowout instead of 2x
* tjw:     xpsave will not save that the player is muted if the player has been
           auto-muted by g_censorMuteTime.
* tjw:     fixed shrubbot/xpsave memory leak.  Thanks AK:Waters.
* kw:      Campaigns sometimes couldn't load when server had lots of campaigns.
* josh:    Changed initial map and skill weightings to 0.5 each.
* tjw:     fix kill spree messages when players have keys in their names.
* tjw:     fix custom obituary messages when players have keys in their names.
* tjw:     fix for limited lives spectator exploit.
* tjw:     g_shuffle_rating was using the wrong values.
* tjw:     fix for etmain prone -> scoped weapon -> unprone bug
* tjw:     fix for following a teammate as he switches teams bug
* tjw:     g_throwableKnives 0 really disables /throwknife
* tjw:     pass g_throwableKnives value to client in CS_ETPUBINFO
* tjw:     added playsound_env for etadminmod compatability
* tjw:     playsound and playsound_env are now properly g_tyranny protected
           when used to play a sound to a specific client.


0.7.1
* josh:    Updated player rating model so that the better players on the team
           get less points for winning than the worse ones, and they lose
           more points for losing. This will prevent rating inflation.
* josh:    No more swapping with g_ATB 2, only moving. But, g_ATB 2 will move
           anyone, not just the top 3. It will start with the top 3. This way
           the best players aren't hammered as much.
* josh:    Those g_ATB'd 2 swapped can't move back during the match, but the
           ATB count is reset on each map. This should be ok since everyone
           is a move candidate. Though it will mean the best are still moved
           first. This is kind of a hack that should be replaced with a
           boolean on the map that says whether or not someone has been ATB'd
           that map. That would be better.
* josh:    Replaced the last change with map_ATBd_team which tracks the last
           team ATB'd too. This way the best players won't be the first on
           every map AND those ATB'd can only play on the last team they were
           ATB'd to. ATB_count is not reset now.
* josh:    Added !howfair which prints a simple summary of team fairness
           based on player rating. This is printed to everyone on chat.
* josh:    Added a fun little hack that for now shows player rating in the
           scoreboard instead of XP, although it still says XP. This will
           happen if you add 4 to g_playerRating. This will be replaced with
           the new scoreboard by tjw, coming soon to an etpub near josh.
* josh:    Fixed a bug where ATB was never allowing you to switch teams
           without disconnecting.
* josh:    Made it so ATB will unlock a player's ATB'd status if the team
           they have been switched to becomes a little too good as defined by
           g_teamForceBalance_playerrating. This unlock only happens when
           they try and move to a different team, however.
* josh:    g_teamForceBalance_playerrating now checks what a team's
           probability of winning would be AFTER adding that player. If both
           teams become "too good" it will allow the player to join the
           lesser of the two evils.
* josh:    ATB won't move a player if doing so will upset the balance the
           other way. It'll pick a less skilled player instead.
* josh:    When g_inactivity is hit, it will putspec instead of kick.
* josh:    g_ATB 2 will now also act during intermission and warmup.
* josh:    Added time per team tracking for later use in pro-rating rating.
* josh:    Increased player rating learning rate (award) since it updates a
           bit slower now based on how close a player is to his team's
           average.
* josh:    g_spectatorInactivity will only kick if the server is full.
* josh:    Player will now get messages about their end map rating change.
* josh:    Player rating is now prorated by the time a player plays on each
           team. If you play only half the match and play on the winning
           team, you only get half the points, etc.
* josh:    Added the "hero" flag. If you are ATB'd or if you switch to a team
           that only has a 35% chance or worse of winning, you become a hero.
           If you stay with that team, you will get full points if your team
           wins instead of being prorated. Any team change will untoggle the
           flag.
* josh:    PLAYER_RATING_SCOREBOARD will now sort the scoreboard by rating.
* forty:   mine id
* forty:   added g_coverts 256 flag which gives xp for constructive use of smoke
* josh:    Added g_misc 64, gives ZERO fall damage. For those crazy servers.
* forty:   fix mine id toggling.
* josh:    Made sure the ATB unlocking check passes an ent into GetWinProb.
* forty:   #422 - Medpack animation fix by jaquboss
* forty:   #381 - Revive Messages
* forty:   #387 - Optionally forbid teammates from blocking each other's strikes.
* josh:    Moved the win probability model's use of map win / loss records and
           size advantage calculations into allies_rating and axis_rating.
           This will simplify the calculations and allow the model to adapt to
           differences in size advantages per map. The new ratings basically
           say how important your average axis or allies team member is on
           that map.
* kw:      g_msgpos/g_killingSpreePos "3" displays banners/killingsprees at the
           top of the screen (REQUIRES etpub_client).
* kw:      g_msgpos/g_killingSpreePos "4" displays banners/killingsprees only
           into the console.
* kw:      The servercommand "bp" prints messages at the top of the screen
           (REQUIRES etpub_client).
* forty:   Gib logging reports all gibs.
* forty:   #127 - Censor XP loss, and censor burn options
* josh:    Added support for tracking if players have played enough games for
           their player rating to be trusted. Currently, 24 = full trust.
* josh:    Fixed a bug in ATB allowing unstable moves.
* josh:    Fixed a player rating bug giving the wrong points to losers.
* josh:    Added a games left measure to add uncertainty to the probability
           measures when the players are less known.
* josh:    Cleaned up some code to be more in line with the guidelines.
* josh:    Fixed a potentially critical PTB prediction error.
* josh:    !howfair is now customizable with g_teamForceBalance_playerrating
           and g_ATB_diff.
* forty:   #428 - Gib Logging Crash Fix
* josh:    Hero threshold moved to 0.20 or 20%.
* forty:   #377 - g_dropMsg
* forty:   Fix auto temp ban isn't enforced consistently across patch versions.
* forty:   Clients dropped for being banned are now given the reason for banning
           and time until expiration.
* josh:    Changed g_teamForceBalance_playerrating to just a boolean. 0 for on,
           1 for off. The threshold used is now g_ATB_diff. I didn't see a point
           in having two thresholds.
* josh:    From now on, teams will always be balanced by numbers if
           g_teamForceBalance is on. If g_teamForceBalance_playerrating is
           also on, it will balance by numbers ONLY when joining either team
           results in a probability < g_ATB_diff. If you don't want this, set
           g_teamForceBalance to 0. This will also mean that
           g_teamForceBalance_playerrating will no longer trigger
           g_balancedteams, which is probably fair.
* josh:    Switched player rating from being 1600-based to 0-based because of
           better results in simulations. This will necessitate starting the
           ratings over. To do this, I'm using playerrating2,
           rated_games_played, axis_rating2, and allies_rating2. By 0.8, these
           should all just replace the originals, and by 0.9, they should be
           removed.
* josh:    If PLAYER_RATING_VISIBLE isn't set, there will be no ratings points
           messages at the end of the map.
* magik:   added Omni-Bot support (currently supporting Omni-Bot v0.51)
* forty:   Added auto temp ban isn't enforced consistently across patch versions
           with !kick.
* kw:      Fixed a lag "blink" in health display in the crosshairnames of
           disguised coverts which made them easy to spot.
* forty:   stack traces on win32 w/ vc 6 & vc 7.
* matt:    fix linux stack trace compile error
* josh:    Trying to fix a sync bug between Connect and Disconnect
* josh:    Changed  g_ATB_diff default to 80 since in actuality when the model
           says 75 it's really close to 65, but when it says 80 it's not far
           from 75.
* kw:      Spectators can team (voice)chat. (etpub_client >= 20060119 is needed
	   to open the voicechat menu as spectator)
* kw:      added /mt command that sends a private message to matching players
           in your team only.
* forty:   #430 - base race mineid and map mines fix.
* forty:   FORUM - specs/team specs get xp for spot.
* forty:   #423 - Fix Opposite team mine spotted while being diffused
           (by opposing engie) renders mine un-disarmable.
* kw:      major rewrite of the !help command, works more like shrub now.
* forty:   enabled bad connection icon for clients newer than 20051230.
* forty:   Fix riflenade bug, where after firing a rifle grenade and not having
           enough time to finish the automatic switching to the rifle before
           dying, Player ends up with a useless rifle grenade or losing their
           rifle.
* forty:   Add g_canisterKickOwner, set this to 1 gives kicker ownership of the
           kicked canister.
* forty:   #349 - Moved team damage kick to the end of ClientEndFrame to
           prevent invisible clips from forming.
* forty:   #396 - Fix shooting in your own feet when g_panzersVulnerable is
           enabled.
* josh:    Added percent_time into the player rating model. It will now take
           into account how much time has passed and therefore ATB can detect
           the spawnkilling of the the achieving team, or at least if the
           achieving team is being held longer than average. When this
           happens, ATB can move players to that team.
* tjw:     use etmain uniform handling related to satchel/smoke/knife/binoc
           when g_coverts is 0.
* forty:   some additional things needed for etpro mapscripts
* forty:   spawn function for fake brushes
* tjw:     added some modifiers to the time parameter of the !ban command.
           the modifiers are 'm', 'h', 'd', and 'w' meaning minutes, hours,
           days, and weeks respectively.  for example, it is now possible to
           use the command "!ban tjw 2w take two weeks off" to ban tjw for
           2 weeks instead of trying to add up how many seconds that would be.
* josh:    Added SHUFR_PROB which is basically a smarter player rating shuffle.
           It will take into account the map now when it shuffles and greedily
           give the teams closest to 50/50. It's not optimal. If someone wants
           to, they can code up a time bounded branch and bound to find the
           optimal teams. It's option 5, 4 is normal prate shuffle.
* forty:   fun_on_ice/jv-trainjump-v3 crash fix.
* tjw:     ATB must not run run during GS_WARMUP because it goes nuts as
           people connect at the start of warmup.  Also without a respawn
           timer, ATB has no time restraint.
* tjw:     ATB warning message now uses correct color to describe the other
           team.
* tjw:     ATB will stop its infinite swapping fits if moving a player
           would not improve the losing team's score.
* kw:      fixed a server crash issue in the team command.
* kw:      selected weapons are saved over class and team changes.
* kw:      fixed single pistol wasn't selectable at level 4 light weapon skill.
* kw:      added etpro's class and nextteam commands.
* tjw:     don't drop people for g_inactivity when in limbo
* josh:    changed the hero threshold to (1 - g_ATB_diff) and the default
           g_ATB_diff to 70 since recent model evaluations show the time
           weights to make the model conservative instead of extreme.
* tjw:     removed XPSave persistence across STOPWATCH rounds.
* josh:    Added disconnect tracking and fixed a couple of bugs in rating
           updates as well.
* josh:    Changed non-updating calls to GetWinProb to take into account the
           amount of time the players have spent so far, and assume they are
           going to spend the rest of the time on their current team. ATB and
           PTB will have better info this way. What this means is if a player
           joins half-way through, he'll only count as HALF a player instead
           of a full-player. This means PTB will let him join teams it
           wouldn't have in the past.
* josh:    Player rating now assumes the worth of the number of players per
           team grows exponentially instead of linearly. This should result in
           less unevenness in numbers when ATB is running.
* tjw:     added g_coverts 512 flag to bring back the pre 0.6.4 disguise
           handling for knife/binoc/smoke/satchel.
* tjw:     possible fix for GAMESTATE length tracking.
* josh:    ATB uses sums instead of means for team ratings. This prevents a
           lone player from having an effectively high rating.
* josh:    Major changes to ATB. It's back to using win record information
           instead of explicit map weights. So the map rating weights in xpsave
           don't do anything for now, maybe for awhile. This also means that
           g_playerRating_mapPad is used again. Also, in stopwatch mode, rating
           and ATB will ignore all map info. This changes should help ATB
           handle map info information in a more balanced way.
* kw:      Throwing knives inside a tank, while leaning or using binocs fixed.
* josh:    g_shuffle_rating 5 should work OK now. Let me know if it doesn't.
* josh:    In stopwatch mode, rating updates will proceed the same, but non-
           updating calls to G_GetWinProbability will ignore map info. This
           makes the updating calls more fair.
* tjw:     added message for dropped clients related to g_XPSave 8
* josh:    Fixed a bug that broke hero detection.
* josh:    Fixed a team force balance bug that prevented ATB'd players from
           rejoining their ATB'd team if it had too many players and it wasn't
           to unfair.
* josh:    Even stopwatch rounds will be ignored in ratings updates until the
           probability model accounts for the shorter timelimit.
* tjw:     possible fix for g_shortcuts related crashes
* josh:    PLAYER_RATING_DATASET now logs when objectives are accomplished and
           outputs the timelimit on maps.
* josh:    Began adding support for including objective times in ratings.
* josh:    Added tc_base.script to the Examples because the original tc_base
           marks completed objectives as "failed" instead of "complete" which
           will confuse later versions of the player rating system. Whoever
           writes the docs for 0.7.1, PLEASE tell them to use this script if
           they are going to use player rating with tc_base.
* forty:   ps->grenadeTimeLeft was not fully predicted.
* josh:    Added rank to xpsave_table.php
* tjw:     fixed coloring of "(called by NAME)" when using g_voting 4 flag
           (this only effects newer etpub_client)
* tjw:     even g_ATB 2 is now limited to only moving one person per team
           spawn cycle.
* tjw:     Applied jaybird's fix for possible floating point calculation
           problem that can lead to crashing in G_RunThink().  Thanks jaybird.
* tjw:     seperated code for g_ATB 1 and g_ATB 2 so it's more readable.
* tjw:     g_ATB 2 now tries to keep the teams balanced in number of players
           as well as skill.
* tjw:     duplicate guid drop message should not contain guid since it gets
           broadcast to all players.
* tjw:     g_ATB 2 will now try to balance teams by number immediatly after
           moving someone.
* tjw:     discover max timelimit from mapscript to use in calculations for
           playerrating, ATB, and max live computation on maps with variable
           timelimits like temple and daybreak.
* tjw:     added checking to keep party panzer from using up all available
           game entities and crashing the server.
* josh:    Added network code for sending http posts to a web server. I don't
           recommend using it without threads. bgr is preparing a thread
           library we can use. The net code will be used for sending any
           information you like to a web server. The example I coded in will
           send chats to a web server somewhere. This way you can have a web
           page that shows server chats. But don't use it as is. It will lag
           the server on every chat. That's why I put that qfalse there. I'll
           make it grab the host name, etc., only once per url change. Also,
           the net code isn't adapted for windows yet. I need to add some
           ifdefs that I haven't yet, sorry.
* josh:    Added windows support to g_http_client.c. Probably. Needs testing
* tjw:     changed ATB shutoff time from 5 mins before map end to 3 mins.
* josh:    Added some preliminary threading support, but it's useless until we
           can link threading libraries statically into qagame. Anyone know
           how to do that?
* josh:    Increased kill rating points on the flamethrower from 4 to 8 based
           on tjw's discovery that there are at least twice as many kills with
           the 4 point panzer.
* josh:    Added !balance (uses shuffle's admin rights 'S') which calls one
           cycle of ATB to balance teams.
* josh:    ATB wouldn't even the numbers if it didn't bring the odds below
           g_ATB_diff---even if it did improve them. Now ATB will be able to
           move players to even numbers even when it won't completely fix the
           odds---as long as they don't get worse. This will allow numbers
           balancing when odds balancing may not be possible or easy.
* josh:    Also, ATB wouldn't move anyone to odds balance if it didn't bring
           the prob below ATB_diff. Now, it will still move a player even if
           it doesn't completely fix things. The next ATB run may be able to
           fix things even more. We could make it odds balance more than one
           at a time by letting it recurse for that reason too, but we may not
           have to. It does mean waiting an extra spawn though.
* josh:    Modified kill rating to prorate the update based on the amount of
           damage you do instead of just the kill itself. This will make sure
           whoever does the most damage to you gets the update. So if someone
           much better than you almost kills you, you won't lose to much if a
           n00b comes along and finishes you off.
* josh:    Made kill rating a float so you don't miss out on small points.
* josh:    Fixed a major bug in player certainty for !howfair.
* josh:    Found another bug in player certainty for !howfair.
* josh:    If you've been ATBd, you can't change to another team unless the
           map changes or the odds swing the other way---even if ATB is turned
           off. This is to make !balance more effective on non-ATB servers.
* josh:    Added "Start of warmup." and "Start of round." to the log. Used
           this convention because it's how shrubet did it and those no reason
           to do it different. For log watchers mostly.
* tjw:     pthreads is now dlopen()'d in an effort to make the qagame.so
           compatable for glibc 2.1 through 2.3.  Thanks bgr for figuring
           this out for me.
* tjw:     "Project: Bug Fix" 073 merged
* tjw:     "Project: Bug Fix" 080 merged
* tjw:     "Project: Bug Fix" 081 merged
* tjw:     "Project: Bug Fix" 083 merged
* josh:    Added an http ratings post. At the end of each map it will post one
           line per player with GUID, PR, KR_match, KR_overall, and name.
           Currently it will create one thread per player. When bgr adds the
           thread queue stuff, I'll make it more efficient. Set
           g_httpPostURL_ratings to enable this.
* tjw:     added initial support for killrating and playerrating score commands.
* forty:   fix for !resetmyxp gives a full chargebar exploit
* josh:    match_killrating is now the change in overall_killrating within a
           match instead of a separate killrating.
* forty:   fix for multiple helmets with antilag disabled
* tjw:     fixed bug with checking for game ending dyno plants that let
           the "cvar" script action run.
* josh:    Fixed a bug in damage-based kill rating that gave too much credit
           to single instances of high damage.
* josh:    Added preliminary g_tactics code. So far what this does is make it
           so when you shoot an SMG with at least one enemy within your fOV,
           you will hit that player no matter what. It will pick the closest
           player to you. It makes sure they're visible as well. I need to add
           something to the client that takes the angles stored in
           ps.stats[STAT_AIMING_*] and actually moves the aim of the player.
           This will make it more intuitive. I also still need to add some
           randomness based on your LW, BS, and distance.
* josh:    Added snapping to server-side aiming. It will snap the client's view
           to the chosen target now.
* josh:    Added g_httpPostURL_log (ticket 464). All log entries in
           G_LogPrintf will be posted if a URL is given. Only on linux and
           maybe MacOS (untested?) currently. The LogPrintfs in the posting
           code won't get http posted though. Maybe later.
* josh:    ATBd team is now tracked across disconnects.
* josh:    tactics auto-aiming is done randomly based on distance, LW, and BS.
           You start at 66% likely to hit and go up / down from there. Still
           need to make weapon specific effects. I also need to change the
           hackish way I prevent you from damaging when you "miss". I just set
           damage to 0 but still call Bullet_Fire. I need to simulate a real
           miss.
* josh:    Auto-aimed misses are handled in Bullet_Fire_Extended now.
* forty:   Added g_floodprotect which moves the flood protection code into the
           mod code and disables the engine flood protection.
           callvote, say/vsay/teamsay/etc, fireteam, rconauth, ready, specinvite,
           teamready, ref are currently rate limited.
* josh:    Cleaned up antilag code and fixed the real unremovable helmet bug.
* josh:    Added headshots to g_tactics. Also, you will ALWAYS aim at the head
           now, even if the randomness decides you will only hit the body. The
           only time you won't aim at the head is if you roll almost 3 higher
           than the difficulty. This is, like, a critical miss and you won't
           aim at all.
* forty:   Added thread/http_client support for win32.
* tjw:     fixed damage stats so they don't count more damage than the victim
           had to give.  This was most noticable on goomba kills and
           construction madness.  (Ticket 468)
* tjw:     added some shrubbot flags:
              '0' - is not effected by any inactivity setting (removed from the
                    '1' flag.)
              '!' - any shrubbot command will have no effect on a player with
                    this flag.
              '@' - no matter what level a player with this flag has, he
                    will show up as a level 0 admin in !listplayers.
* josh:    Tactics now aims MG42s on tanks, etc., and the weapons are now
           balanced for skill and distance.
* forty:   Fixed bug with flood protect.
* tjw:     g_shuffle_rating 5 now does essentially the same thing as !shuffle
           followed by !balance if g_shuffle_rating was 4.
* josh:    g_tactics aiming will ignore playdeads. They can be shot normally.
* tjw:     added SBP() as a buffered alternative to SP() for use with shrubbot
           commands with a lot of output.  This should help !listplayers lag.
* tjw:     added SBP() support to !listteams, !help, and !showbans
* tjw:     the "made" parameter should now be consistent across all platforms
           this will make the output of !showbans consistent for newly created
           bans.
* tjw:     added a new optional shrubbot.cfg element called [command].
           (see docs)
* tjw:     cache probabilities when using g_playerRating to lessen server load.
* tjw:     added playerrating tracking for a player's skill levels (e.g. battle
           sense) at the time of every playerrating change.  in the future,
           this will be used to adjust playerrating importance in win
           probability calculations depending on the players current class
           and skill level.  currently off by default, requires g_playerRating
           32 flag for now.
* tjw:     updated skill pr tracking so that it desperses rating points based
           on total time a player was at each skill level instead of just using
           the skill level class he was using at the end of the round.
* tjw:     added caching if cl_guid from ClientConnect() so reduce the
           amount of userinfo parsing. WARNING: if you're running nightly
           builds you probably want to backup your xpsave.cfg and shrubbot.cfg
           just in case.
* josh:    Rebalanced the weapon ratings for kill rating.
* tjw:     added disconnect tracking for skill-based playerrating tracking.
* tjw:     Oops, I never fully added lives tracking into the new XPSave.
           I added it now using the new disconnect tracking.
* josh:    Added prinfo and krinfo console / rcon commands which give player
           and kill ratings sorted and by team. Also made the prob model
           global in level.win_probability_model for more informative howfair
           info, etc. Really shouldn't be used without a G_GetWinProb call
           beforehand though.
* josh:    Replaced console / rcon command ratingsinfo with winprob which
           gives A LOT of info about the current win_probability_model,
           including timeleft! Yay!
* josh:    krinfo gives averages and so does prinfo. prinfo also  gives time
           related info per player now, including the effective player rating
           of that player for that team, assuming he stays on that team for the
           rest of the match. Note that the average given in prinfo takes into
           account disconnects. Disconnects are shown as well.
* josh:    Fixed a bug that allowed KR updates when the victim was already
           dead. This could lead to large, negative KRs since the damage ratio
           would be negative.
* tjw:     fix for getting stuck in walls/solids.
* tjw:     set default shrubbot levels properly.
* tjw:     new shrubbot flags '!' and '@' do not get implied with the '*'
           wildcard.  they are meant for individual admins only.
* matt:    hopefully fixed team_maxCLASS cvars incorrectly calculating team
           totals
* kw:      Referee's can vote a second time to instantly pass/fail a running
           vote. Referee's can now also vote as spectator.
* tjw:     Added ensiform's COM_StripExtensionSafe and fixed remapShader arg
           handling. (from ticket:502)
* josh:    ATB will ignore map info DURING a stopwatch round. At the end of
           the first round it will still update using map info. It will not
           update at the end of the second round since we would have to track
           either the effects of time or how long each player spent on both
           teams throughout both rounds.
* josh:    Made major changes to the player rating and related systems. The
           main difference is that there is now a measure of uncertainty
           with the players' ratings. They have a rating and a variance. The
           currently stored player_rating_variance is NOT the variance though,
           it is a running SUM over 25 matches of the variance. Maps have
           ratings again, and variances with those ratings as well. Again,
           divide by 25 to get the variance. Take the square root of that to
           get the standard deviation. A player's effective rating on a map
           is: player_rating + map_rating. So if a player's rating is 1.2 and
           the axis rating for the current map is -0.2, his effective rating
           is 1.0.

           Fairness is no longer judged by an arbitrary cutt-off either.
           Instead, if 2 standard deviations lower than a team's mean winning
           probability is still above 50%, then that time is "too" likely to
           win. This is when both ATB and forced balancing will kick in. This
	   means etpub will change the threshold adaptively based on how well
	   it knows the teams and how well it knows the map.

	   Updated howfair to use a range instead of a point as well. The
	   ranges used are generally 2*std_dev.

           I removed a lot of no longer used stuff as well. This WILL reset
           your player ratings.
* josh:    Added the /adrenother command in conjuction with g_medics 128. If
           this is enabled, level 4 medics can adren others by using the
           command /adrenother. It will be altfire in etpubclient.
           It will act like normal adren and use the full
           charge bar and one medic needle.
* josh:    Added g_medics 256 which prevents medics from using adren on
           themselves. Medics won't even GET adren.
* josh:    The PR code is now Bayesian with normal / gaussian distributions
           for priors on both the map and player ratings. The prior
           distribution is currently N(0,2.0) or 0-mean 2.0 variance for the
           players, and N(0,0.66) for the map-side ratings. The mean and
           variance of the players and maps will always "shrink" a little back
           towards the priors. The more games you play, the more you can
           overcome the priors. We can now say we have a Bayesian PR system,
           yay!
* josh:    ATB will display howfair before an odds balance as well as after
           so players can see why it acted.
* josh:    Removed some of the vsp-specific stuff I had left in
           xpsave_table.php. Sorry.
* josh:    Fixed some more xpsave.php bugs
* josh:    Added some preliminary structures for using g_etpub_stats_id, etc.
           The matchinfo structures are for queueing match results to
           eventually send them to a master server.
* josh:    rated_games for players is now a float. It's the sum of the percent
           of the games each player played in. So playing half of two games is
           the same as playing one full game.
* josh:    Added a server bias to the PR system since it results in closer to
           70% overall accuracy vs. the 64% we're at now.
* josh:    Added prresetplayers and prreseteverything commands to allow admins
           to completely reset parts of the PR system. These may be useful for
           admins who have run pre-release versions of the system that are no
           longer as valid mathematically at release time.
* josh:    Added some preliminary code for later improving the curse filter
* matt:    Hopefully fixed nightly build problems, win32 compile problems
* josh:    Fixed a bug that allowed bots to log team and class changes before
           logging ClientConnect.
* josh:    g_censorNames now catches renames as well as connects.
* josh:    Fixed resetting variance in prreset and prreseteveryting. Thanks
           NHLfan.
* josh:    fixed a censor problem that was always using the names dictionary
           instead of the words one for chats.
* josh:    fixed some of the stat theory and changed the priors on the
           variances to ones that work better. This will make predictions
           more accurate.
* josh:    Switched back from using ranges on the probability of a team
           winning to using just the prediction and a threshold because it's
           actually more correct. Always use
           level.win_probability_model.moderated_probability when making a
           judgement call from a prediction. The moderated_probability takes
           into account the current uncertainty about players, maps, and the
           server itself. This is better to use in ATB, PTB, howfair, and the
           scoreboard. NOTE: Remember to call G_GetWinProbability before using
           level.win_probability_model.
* josh:    Fixed a bug where stopwatch ATB'ing was still taking into account
           map variance.
* matt:    Implemented map voting features if server is set to gametype 6
* josh:    Ported Neil Toronto's censor filter over from the altfire cgame to
           qagame. It'll catch some symbol and number replacements, and spaces
           now. It also adds some common words and common words with "swears"
           in them that should really be OK. For example, it will not censor
           "assassin" but it will censor "ass". If you want Neil's word
           lists, then set g_censorNeil and g_censorNamesNeil to 1. These are
           decent word lists, by the way, I recommend setting those to 1. You
           can view the lists in g_censor.c. If there's a NULL next to a word,
           then that word is OK whereas if there's a substitution next to it,
           then it's NOT OK.
* josh:    Adding 4 to g_killRating will result in log file lines that give
           the guids of the players involved in kills. This makes kill
           tracking a lot easier.
* magik:   Added support for Omni-Bot 0.52 stable.
* josh:    Removed "shag" from Neil's filter. If it's offensive where you are,
           add it to g_censor.
* josh:    Changed xpsave.php and xpsave_table.php to reflect the effects of a
           player's kill rating and player rating in more understandable
           terms. KR K/D is how many kills a player would get against other
           *average* players before dying. It's an adjusted Kills per Death
           measure. PR Win% is how often you would win if you played with 19
           other players who were all average players. We will eventually work
           these numbers into the scoreboard.
* josh:    Added etpub_stats.pl as an extra for etadmin_mod, etc., users.
* josh:    Added some suggestions from deej for consistency and compiling on
           64-bit architectures.
* matt:    Fixed bug that caused clients joining during intermission to create
           negative vote totals
* matt:    Hopefully fixed objective/bot bug
* matt:    Fixed mapvoting exploit
* josh:    Converted most of the player rating reports to show PR win %
           instead.
* josh:    Converted KR reports to show KR K/D. This requires the new client
           to look right since KR was an int before client-side.
* josh:    Only send KR K/D to new enough clients.
* josh:    Added support for submission of match info to a central stats
           server. Ready for global stats alpha / beta soon. Servers
           that want to participate in the beta need to contact me
           directly---do NOT just set g_etpub_stats_id at this point without
           talking to me first.
* zeebok (josh):  Debugged my (josh) match sending stats code. Thanks!
* josh:    Made the match posting code non-threaded. It doesn't crash now, as
           far as I can tell. It could potentially lag intermission a bit if
           there's a tcp timeout, but it's just intermission---no biggie.
* josh:    The time counter for player time per team will now ignore skulled
           players. This will only slightly affect ATB since ATB won't move
           anyone after a few skulls anyways. Endgame stats updates will be
           more accurate though.
* gabriel: Merged in exploit fix by Dens: [p] shortcut could be used to
           detect an enemy in disguise
* gabriel: Merged in CheckIntermissionExit() fixes by Dens: 1) Spectators and
           newly-connected players do not count for intermission ready pct,
           2) /ref allready ends intermission again, and 3) Fixes a bug in
           which etpub does not load the next map until a player connects
* gabriel: Merged in G_shrubbot_admintest() fix by Dens: !admintest does not
           display the level name of a user when that user is not in the
           shrubbot.cfg file (which would make the user level 0)
* gabriel: Merged fix by Dens: !warn does not display the warning message in
           the intermission
* gabriel: CheckIntermissionExit() changes: Undid a change by Dens: Spectators
           count for readypercent (since they can press the ready button), and
           can vote on maps (since the client counts their vote).  Also, bots
           are now completely disregarded for readypercent and map voting
           purposes
* gabriel: Another bugfix by Dens (Thanks!): !ban command without a time
           modifier removed the last character in the time parameter
* gabriel: Dens bug fix merged for G_shrubbot_ban_check(): 1) Connecting
           permanently banned players see "NEVER" as the ban expiration date
           now. 2) Users banned without a reason do not see "Reason: " anymore
* gabriel: Removed spaces from omni-bot's GUID to work around a bug in
           g_xpsave.c (multiple spaces in the settings are not preserved), that
           caused many duplicate entries for bots in the xpsave file
* gabriel: Dens bug fix merged for G_players_cmd(): Ready spectators were being
           ignored in /players command
* gabriel: Fixed G_shrubbot_admintest() bug: If the server was set up with
           non-sequential shrubbot level numbers, !admintest would use the
           wrong shrubbot element index
* josh:    Slight change to g_medics 256. Medics won't get self-adren ammo at
           all now, like before. But if non-medics are allowed adren, they will
           be able to use it fine. If you don't want non-medics to have adren,
           then change your g_skills setting.
* gabriel: Applied kamikazee's bugfixes for map scripts, as explained here:
           http://splashdamage.com/index.php?name=pnPHPbb2&file=viewtopic&t=15243
* gabriel: Forced g_ATB_rating and g_shuffle_rating to have legal values when
           g_ATB is set to 2
* gabriel: Merged in changes for omni-bot 0.521
* gabriel: Fixed VC6 project files so that: 1) correct omni-bot interface file
           is compiled, and 2) post-build file copy step is eliminated.

0.7.2
* gabriel: added comma (,) as a separator for party panzer pattern
* gabriel: hopefully fixed a bug with buffered prints and rcon
* gabriel: fixed server crashes with shortcuts when run from the console
* gabriel: several cosmetic fixes to !listplayers output: omnibots display
           "*OMNIBOT*" instead of the GUID fragment, shrubbot level names with
           color codes are correctly justified now
* gabriel: fixed a bug where if g_hitsounds bit 4 was set, no headshot sounds
           were ever heard
* gabriel: fixed !showbans formatting when color codes are in the banned server
           name or in the banner
* gabriel: merged KillSpree bugfix code by Dens: All kill spree message
           locations now print where they should
* gabriel: bugfix: lvl4 soldiers can no longer hold both mp40 and thompson at
           the same time
* gabriel: bugfix: prevented players from circumventing /kill restrictions by
           throwing knives to their own feet and killing themselves
* gabriel: exploitfix: implemented mandatory low value for g_throwKnifeWait
           (0.2 sec) to prevent players from binding /throwknife to mouse wheel
           and throwing a ton of knives within a very short amount of time
* gabriel: exploitfix: expanded g_fear to apply to team changes in addition to
           /kill, as some players were switching teams instead of /kill to
           circumvent g_fear
* gabriel: bugfix: Put in bugfix by Dens: headshots were being counted even
           though g_stats flag 1 was enabled
* gabriel: bugfix: several cosmetic changes as submitted by Dens
* gabriel: exploitfix: players that disconnect or change teams will have their
           artillery and airstrikes canceled/removed
* gabriel: bugfix: If there were more than 63 bans no custom commands would be
           read from the shrubbot.cfg file
* josh:    bufix: winprob should work from rcon now.

0.8.1
* gabriel: g_damageXP added to serverinfo string
* gabriel: implemented g_bot_maxXP - Like g_maxXP but for bots only

* gabriel: implemented g_bot_flags with flag 1: disable xpsave for bots
* gabriel: added shortcuts for custom ! commands
* gabriel: added [g] (GUID) shortcut
* gabriel: added parameter placeholders [1]..[9] to the [command] section
* gabriel: added kill and death spree sounds
* gabriel: added SPC functionality as submitted by Dens.  The result of some
           commands will be switched from SP() to SPC() so that the result
           prints on both the console and the chat area instead of just the
           console
* gabriel: merged in _shrubbot_immutable() function submitted by ensiform for
           better error messages when shrubbot commands are performed on immune
		   (! flag) targets
* gabriel: implemented shrubbot command replies using Dens' SPC() function. Now
           shrubbot command replies/results are displayed in the chat area as
           well as the console
* gabriel: "Project: Bug Fix" 087 merged - Player always mouting the last gun
           used, on multiple tank maps
* gabriel: "Project: Bug Fix" 089 merged - Player view is distorted in
           intermission if you have ridden an vehicle, mounted a tank
* gabriel: "Project: Bug Fix" 091 merged - Spawnpoints not movable
* gabriel: "Project: Bug Fix" 094 merged - Playing time shown at debriefing
           keep increasing
* gabriel: "Project: Bug Fix" 095 verify already merged - Campaign window not
           big enough to contain big campaigns
* gabriel: "Project: Bug Fix" 097 merged - Kick command is not able to kick
           some players by name
* gabriel: "Project: Bug Fix" 099 merged - Calling for a lot of artillery or
           airstrikes can result voice over spam
* gabriel: added g_killingSpreeOpts cvar: Controls whether killing sprees end
           when player does /kill or switches teams
* gabriel: changed killspree sounds to have a configurable sound for every kill
           spree message that can be displayed.  It can be said that there is
           full killspree sound support as of this change
* gabriel: added modifiers to g_xpDecayRate (/d: per day, /m: per minute,
           etc...) see docs for full details
* gabriel: added modifiers to g_XPSaveMaxAge ((d)ays, m(o)nths, etc...) see
           docs for full details
* gabriel: added modifiers to g_XPSaveMaxAge_xp ((d)ays, m(o)nths, etc...) see
           docs for full details
* gabriel: added g_bot_flag #2 flag: Bots are automatically granted ! command
           immunity (the ! shrubbot privilege flag)
* gabriel: added g_bot_flag #4 flag: Bots cannot be !kicked or !banned
* gabriel: added g_maxXPResetWarn, which enables warnings to players who are
           about to get their XP reset due to g_maxXP
* gabriel: expanded g_maxXPResetWarn to be able to hold negative values which
           will be interpreted to mean offsets from g_maxXP (-50 means 50 XP
           before reset, -5% means when 95% of g_maxXP has been reached)
* gabriel: implemented client-side weapons restrictions enforcement (team_max*
           cvars): Unavailable weapons will be marked as "not available" in the
           limbo menu. Requires etpub client > 20060818.
* josh:    bugfix: Helmet loss and regain with antilag on is now stable.
* josh:    bugfix: major ATB bug repaired. It was NEVER helping the Allies,
           only Axis.
* josh:    Major upgrade of PR system, code cleanup (a little). Much more
           accurate. This will require major changes to etpub_stats.pl and the
           php stuff.
* josh:    Updated extras for new ratings.
* josh:    Removed warn from ATB. It was either not noticed or abused.
* josh:    Fixed howfair before and after ATB so it reports before correct.
* josh:    g_noTeamSwitching now forces same teams even after goin spec and
           disconnecting. Notice, this will allow players to join back on
           potentially unfair or unbalanced teams, and therefore is not
           recommended without some form of team balancing, be it ATB or
           active admins.
* josh:    Going back to only one move per map with ATB. This gets reset if
           you go spec though.
* matt:    Added crude g_excludedMaps support for g_gametype 6
* matt:    Added g_mapConfigs support for files names vote_X.cfg when in
           g_gametype 6 mode (See docs)
* gabriel: Added "X%-" format to team_max* cvars.  This uses a floor() call
           instead of ceil() for computing allowed class types per team.
* gabriel: Added weapons restrictions percentages.  This will enable admins to
           restrict weapons depending on the number of players in the server.
           The same percentage rules apply as the team_max* cvars
* josh:    Added g_ATB_offtime which shuts off ATB after offtime minutes. It's
           so admins can leave ATB on for just the first 5 minutes, etc.
           Defaults to 0. This is for those who don't like ATB fixing things
           mid-map even when they get bad. Hopefully there is less churn
           after, say, 5 minutes. Then, if g_teamForceBalance_playerrating is
           on, new joiners will be balanced passively anyways.
* tjw:     antilag was adjusting for a time that is slightly too old
* forty:   fix overbounces.
* forty:   pmove_fixed _should_ work right now. recoil problems and jitters
           fixed.

           pmove_accurate code from q3.
           only options 0 and 1 implemented for now.
* forty:   fix negative damage stats.
* forty:   bacon's dyno counters
* forty:   #601 - jaguboss's client-side hitbox prediction

* matt:    g_asblock option (32) added to give 2 XP Battle Sense for blocking
           an airstrike.  No XP given for blocking a teammate's or your own
           airstrike
* forty:   #258 - !spec999 -> notification when 0 users moved to spec
* forty:   #453 - Ammo packs resupply Adrenaline

* forty:   #608 - g_fear minor bug
* forty:   #607 - Merge in Density's damage received display code
* forty:   Added g_misc 256, 512, 1024 options
           256 - Enable New TraceAllParts Code - Default

           1024 - Old Etpub CrouchMaxZ
* forty:   #612 - playdeads on tank
* forty:   PatheticCockroach's vote_allow_shufflenorestart display fix.
* forty:   Ensiform's rcon !help fix.
* forty:   Den's minimum shrubbotlevel required to connect patch.
* forty:   #474 - don't give xp if we're picking up our own ammo/med packs.
* forty:   #511 - make an rcon command for shuffling without restart
* forty:   Keep landmines from being merged into snapshots if they are not in a
           players PVS. (2.56 and up)
* forty:   Make sweeps for landmines take a bit less time.
* matt:    fixed g_classChange bug that gave thompson to axis player when they
           stole a teammates uni
* matt:    !uptime (u) shrubbot flag
* josh:    Added preliminary player behavior tracking: just mouse velocity
* forty:   DrEvil - Omni-bot 0.6 support
* forty:   VC6 Fixes for Omni-bot 0.6 support
* josh:    g_tactics: Made tactics a rock paper scissors-type game. Each class
           has a class it can kill easily, one not so easy, and one very hard.
           M > S > E > F > C > M.
* matt:    added uneven team notification (g_unevenTeamDiff, g_unevenTeamFreq)
* matt:    hopefully fixed ws exploit and unignore crash without breaking
           functionality
* matt:    merged Density's anti IP/GUID spoofing code
* stephan: fixed floodprotection bug that disabled /ref commands

           flag

           binoculars
* stephan: fixed a bug where a medic would get adrena upon reaching level 4,
           even though adrena was disabled
* stephan: removed a small !help display bug
* stephan: all shrubbot command output should have the same look now
* stephan: added g_noVoteTime cvar that sets a minimum time between two votes
* stephan: completely changed the killingspree system. All old killinspree
           cvars are removed and g_setting, g_spreeOptions and g_multikillTime
           are added. Furthermore a new settings file is made which contains
           the spree settings. Finally multikills are added. Read the docs
           carefully and look at the example settings.cfg to see how to enable
           sprees.
* stephan: fixed a small omnibot 0.6 path problem (needs 0.61 omnibot files
           though)
* stephan: added cvar g_spoofing which gives admins the possibility to disable
           the spoofing protection (see the docs for more information about
           this protection)
* stephan: added !userinfo (e) shrubbot command
* stephan: added !stats (t) shrubbot command
* stephan: fixed a bug in omnibot 0.6 where gibbing a bot would cause an extra
           body and a weird spectator mode
* stephan: added [banner] blocks to the g_settings file. This replaces the old
           cvars g_msgs, g_msgpos and g_msgX.
* stephan: added g_mapVoteFlags 16 which makes a nextmap vote go to
           intermission so people can vote which map should be played next
* stephan: added multiple output for one spree/end/multikill
* stephan: added g_bot_flags 8: bots cannot mount tanks
* stephan: g_spoofing removed and g_spoofOptions added (better name). A lot of
           changes made to this cvar, so read the docs carefully
* stephan: added g_coverts flag 1024: a disguised covert can still steal an
           enemy uniform
* stephan: added g_spreeOptions flag 128: multikill messages will be delayed to
           prevent flooding
* stephan: added advanced warnings. Cvars: g_warningDecay, g_warningOptions and
           g_maxWarnings
* stephan: someone who is kicked for reaching the max amount of warnings is now
           kicked for 120 secs
* stephan: changed g_auoTempBan into a bitflag, so teamdamage, !kick and !warn
           tempbans are separated
* stephan: added g_spreeOptions flag 256: killing bots doesn't count in
           sprees/multikills
* josh:    Turned off threads. They're a pain and not used.
* josh:    Changed g_teamForceBalance_playerrating to override and allow
           players to enter unfair teams if the numbers are imbalanced.
* josh:    Made g_ATB 2 event driven so it only runs once per team change, and
           will not run after a !putteam command.
* josh:    Made it so ATB will allow unfair teams when numbers balancing if
           numbers are off by more than 2.
* stephan: added an orange W to !listplayers output, that appears when someone
           has a warning. Also moved the fireteam letter to appear right after
           the team letter
* josh:    Added kill rating tracking to match outcome logging in order to
	   investigate the possiblity of including kill rating in predicting
	   winners.
* stephan: removed shrubbot !finger command and added shrubbot flag $ instead.
           $ allows users to do an !admintest on other players
* stephan: fixed bots not leaving when setting g_bot_minplayers 0
* josh:    ATB will allow 2 more players on a team, but not 3
* josh:    Made sure ATB will only run after someone goes spec or disconnects.
	   This means it won't fight with PTB. If you can get on a team by
	   your server's rules (balancing) then ATB won't try and fix it.
* josh:    !putteam only turns off ATB when it puts a player on axis or
	   allies.
* stephan: fixed a bug where ending a spree with a teamkill, would play the
           selfkill sound
* stephan: g_bot_minplayers default value is now -1
* stephan: added g_voting flag 8 that displays the number of YES and NO votes
           after a vote passed or failed. This also displays if a vote is
           is passed or canceled by an admin.
* stephan: added g_privateMessageSound which plays a sound to all player that
           receive a private message
* stephan: /players command now gives the total number of humans and bots
* stephan: !passvote and !cancelvote give some output when there is no vote
* stephan: added g_maxNameChanges cvar, that limits the number of namechanges
           at one map
* stephan: added g_medicHealthRegen flag 7 and 8 which allow medic to
           regenerate health only when they have full "normal" health allready
* stephan: omnibot 0.65 support added by gabriel
* josh:    With zinx's code and permission and a little help from Jaybird, added
	   etpro's antiwarp code. Use g_antiwarp 1. It will override both
	   g_maxWarp AND g_skipCorrection in order to keep things consistent.
* stephan: removed g_bot_flags cvar. All options can be set by using the
           omnibot cvar omnibot_flags. See the (ETPub) docs for more details
* stephan: from now on bots won't be tempbanned for doing too much teamdamage
* stephan: The g_dropMsg is now added to every !kick and !ban and not just to
           the message shown when a banned player tried to reconnect
* stephan: added g_medics flag 4: when a level 4 medic gets revived he will
           always receive full health (same goes for syringe heal)
* stephan: added g_floodWait which controls the miminum time between 2 (v)says
* matt:    Fixed minor map voting bug
* stephan: added g_disableComplaints flag 8: no complaints for dynamite tk
* stephan: added omnibot 0.66 support
* stephan: added g_misc flag 4 (display killer health) as submitted by chaos
* stephan: applied g_medicSelfhealTime patch by Chaos. This CVAR prevents a
           medic to pick up its own medpacks after being hit
* stephan: added g_maxPanzerSuicides which makes panzerfaust shoot medpacks
           after too much panzerselfkills. Idea based on OPENShrub's special
           panzer, but bit different functionallity
* stephan: fixed minor nameCensor bug (Thanks ensiform)
* stephan: added variable mutetime storage in the XPSave file. The !mute
           command now supports the optional [TIME] and [REASON]. Time can be
           a number of seconds, or a time with modifier (see !ban for more
           information). Note that all players that are muted will be unmuted
           the first time you use 0.8.x
* stephan: added g_damageXPLevel to the serverinfo string (splatterladder
           request)
* stephan: added g_dyno flag 8: dynamite can only be disarmed by the other team
* stephan: fixed a bug where getting revived after being killed while reloading
           made a player hold WP_NONE (no weapon)
* stephan: added g_spoofOptions flag 256 which checks the userinfo in a similar
           way as Reyalp's lua script. Also changed the default g_spoofOptions
           value to 323 because just too many innocent people were getting
           kicked for guidspoofing
* stephan: added g_dyno flag 16: enable dynamite ID. With ETPubclient >=
           20070719 you can see the owner of a dynamite when you point at it
* stephan: added adminchat "/ma". All users with the shrubbot flag ~ and all
           referees can type and read this chat. When a new adminchat message
           is received, the user will hear the g_privateMessageSound and see
           the adminchat message in orange
* stephan: changed the color of the location (A,1) in team and fireteam chat to
           yellow, so that it better matches fireteam and vsay locations
* stephan: fixed an (omnibot) bug where grabbing unnamed objectives (like the
           christmas star on "Northpole") results in a server crash
* tijmen:  added g_misc flag 8: disable self damage as requested by ticket #408
* stephan: added vote_allow_putspec that gives people the possibility to vote a
           player into spec
* tijmen:  added g_maxSelfkills: amount of times a person can user /kill per
           map
* stephan: added g_panzerPackDistance which controls the packdistance of the
           medpacks fired from the panzerfaust when g_maxPanzerSuicides is
           enabled
* stephan: added g_maxPanzerSuicides option -2: always enabled
* tijmen:  added g_showVoteResults: show the amount of votes per team to
	   admins (and optionally other clients)
	   as requested by ticket #482
* tijmen:  bugfix: xp now writes when someone uses !nextmap, !restart,
           /callvote maprestart, /callvote nextmap, /callvote map *
* tijmen:  added g_minCommandWaitTime: this command sets the time you have to
           wait between using shrubbot commands.
* stephan: removed g_slashkill flag 8 (disable /kill). This can be achieved by
           setting g_maxSelfkills 0
* stephan: fixed g_maxPanzerSuicides display bug
* stephan: changed g_minCommandWaitTime to show the time in milliseconds when
           smaller then 2 secs. Hopefully also fixed the crashes
* stephan: added g_warningOptions flag 16: allow clients to do /warnings
* stephan: added g_knifeKillSound as submitted by balgo
* stephan: added g_XPSave flag 16, which makes the xpsaving at !restarts,
           mapvotes etc optional. Also expanded this to work at campaignvotes.
           Finally made sure that the disconnects get erased at a !restart etc
* stephan: added g_spreeOptions flags 512 + 1024. Flag 512 will display the map
           and overall spreerecords when entering intermission. Spree records
           are saved into the xpsave file automatically (as long as
           g_xpSaveFile is set). When a !restart or something similar (see
           g_XPSave flag 16) takes place, the spreerecords aren't stored by
           default because this might take some extra resources. It can be
           enabled by setting flag 1024. The most resources are used when
           g_XPSave flag 16 is NOT set. Though these resources aren't that bad,
           it is a bit useless to enable this flag when you don't use the
           spreerecords
* stephan: added shrubbot command !spreerecord (t) which shows the spreerecords
* stephan: added consolecommand /clearspreerecords that deletes all records
* stephan: removed shrubbot % flag and g_showVoteResults and added
           g_voteResultsMinLevel instead, because I think this should not have
           been a shrubbot flag and the old CVAR was redundant. See the docs
* stephan: added "warner" line in the [warning] shrubbot block. The "warner" is
           also displayed when using !dewarn [player]
* stephan: changed SPC to remove newlines before text is sent to CLIENTS. There
           should NOT be a trailing \n in an SPC message. This should improve
           the output of shrubbot commands when there are more than 1 username-
           matches
* stephan: hopefully fixed antiwarp. Thanks zinx
* stephan: g_spoofOptions default value changed (again) to 339
* josh:    Added support for logging the distance kills happen at for later
           use in an improved kill rating.
* stephan: [g] and !userinfo changed from full guid, to last 8 characters of
           the guid
* stephan: removed one !rename message (admins would see the !rename twice)
* stephan: fixed weaponrestriction infokey bug
* josh:    g_ATB 2 now uses g_ATB_minPlayers instead of
           g_playerRating_minplayers

0.8.2
* stephan: g_teamChangeKills 0 now doesn't save the health anymore (so you will
           always start with full health). This also fixes a bug where you
           sometimes didn't have full health the very first time when you join
           a team
* stephan: fixed a small vote coloration bug

0.9.1
* josh:    Revamped kill rating. Now it will is based purely on skill and
           distance to target.
* josh:    Updated the xpsave.cfg php viewers to reflect KR change.
* josh:    Major bugfix to new kill rating system. Anyone who started using it
           already may want to delete distance_rating, distance_variance, and
           kill_* from their xpsave .cfg.
* josh:    Fixed etpub_stats.pl to work with new kill rating.
* stephan: added healthdepending speed cvars g_healthSpeedStart and
           g_healthSpeedBottom. See docs for more info
* stephan: added g_weapons flag 2048: knife always gibs a dead player
* stephan: added g_damageBonus and g_damageBonusOpts. See docs for more info
* stephan: moved the promotion rewards from the client to the server, so that
           the server can check if players should really get promotions like
           adrena (requires etpubclient >= 20070819)
* tijmen:  added !gib -1|all, which gibs every player in the game
* tijmen:  added !panzer and !sniperwar, which was finished by Elf Friend
* tijmen:  added custom voicechats, made by Elf Friend
           command: g_customVoiceChats
* quad:    added GeoIP country flags in scoreboard, made by mcwf
           g_scoreboard_cf / cg_scoreboard_cf
* quad:    backstab works on wounded players (instant gib) by Elf
* quad:    added panzer/rifle/sniper war by Elf (was missing from the sources)
           also !panzer, !sniper, !riflewar, and !giba, !splat, !splata
* quad:    added a patch from redeye, with some fixes, greeting sound,
           some shrubbot commands, and others.
* quad:    g_noSkillUpgrades, and the changes yada made to the /ref system
           renamed g_scoreboard_cf to g_countryFlags (and cg_countryFlags too)
* quad:    added foxX's code for ready icon
* quad:    partial support for ETTV, also fix for Ticket #5
           fix for Ticket #10 by RedEye
* flms:    added g_spawnInvulFair by PCR
* drevil:  added support for Omni-bot 0.7
* flms:    allow negative shrubbot levels
* quad:    added more control over "energy" ( class weapon time ) via cvar
           g_chargeType
* flms:    added g_flushItems (NQ)
* flms:    mg's can make headshots
* flms:    you also hear hitsounds when Friendly Fire is off and
           g_reflectFriendlyFire is on
* flms:    mg's can reload midclip
* quad:    Lua API for ETPub, aiming for compatibility with ETPro
           http://wolfwiki.anime.net/index.php/Lua_Mod_API (TODO: Docs!)
* stephan: added an oversized userinfo check to g_spoofOptions flag 256 and
           added the \n char to the list of characters that may not be used in
           a userinfo string. A user with any of the forbidden chars in his/her
           userinfo will be dropped from the server from now on
* quad:    added sv_maxConnsPerIP as a prevention for fakeplayer DoS attack
* stephan: changed sv_maxConnsPerIP to g_maxConnsPerIP, since it is a game cvar
           and not an engine cvar
* stephan: changed the flags of g_damageBonusOpts and added
           g_damageBonusNearMedics and g_damageBonusTotalMedics. See docs
* stephan: changed g_spoofOptions again. Some of the old flags are not optional
           anymore. This prevents the innocent guidspoofkick many people were
           experiencing. Furthermore an empty IP field is not allowed anymore.
           Default value set to 3
* pheno:   fixed xpsave [serverstat] parse error on distance_variance
