--------
* josh: Added antilag debug output to the client for internal testing only
        This client will also make the server hitboxes blue when g_debugBullets
        is on and it will draw red hitboxes for what the client sees. Output
        is on the console.
* tjw:  used new PM_TraceAll() from 2.60 in playdead checking
* tjw:  improved PM_TraceAll() related checking to test for players heads
        and legs instead of just legs.  This should prevent player models
        from sticking through doors when prone or dead next to them.

* tjw:  "Project: Bug Fix" 037 merged (cgame)
* tjw:  "Project: Bug Fix" 049 merged (cgame and ui)
* tjw:  added 'forcecvar' server command.  this will of course only work
        if using the client mod.  unmodified clients will see the message
        "Unknown client game command: forcecvar".
* tjw:  improved etpromapscripts compatibility.  need client mod in order
        to see "You are near the Back Door" popup.

20050526
--------
* tjw:  client mod won't draw the wounded message when playing dead.
* tjw:  client mod won't predict EV_NOFIRE_UNDERWATER.  this means if
        you're using g_weapons 2 or 4 flags, you won't hear clicking
	when using syringe or pliers underwater.
* tjw:  removed +lookup, -lookup, +lookdown, and -lookdown commands from the
        client mod.  these are used for anti-recoil cheats.
* tjw:  etpub_client now tries very hard not to save any of the forcecvar
        cvars in the profile etconfig.cfg file.  also, once forcecvar is
        used to set a client cvar, the client can no longer modify it
	(until they restart their client).

20050927
--------
* tjw:  I made a mistake merging Project: Bug Fix 049.  (thanks for pointing it
        out Chruker).  this has to do with map name drawing in etpub_client.
* tjw:  Added check for vote_allow_maprestart in vote menu
* tjw:  added several 2.60 files to the SVN repo that were missing
* josh: The client is now aware of double jump so it can better predict the
        effects. This means people double jumping should be able to aim better.
* matt: added cg_drawTime, cg_drawTimeSeconds, to draw local time
        underneath the FPS display, cg_drawTime can be 0 (not displayed),
        1 (24 hr clock) or 2 (12 hour clock with am/pm). cg_drawTimeSeconds
        will display seconds
* matt: added etpub menu option, with HUD customization choices for
        customizing the drawing of local time (see cg_drawTime,
        cg_drawTimeSeconds)  Also added options for atmosphericeffects
        (rain/snow), cg_drawFPS, cg_drawLagometer

         example hud hud/stumpy.hud added
* matt:  Fixed bug in hud file loading that caused MinGW compiled clients
         to stop displaying the chat areas
* tjw:   Added etpubc.h and server version detection.  You can now use
         the macro ETPUB_VERSION() and the variable cgs.etpub to enable
         features in the client depending on what version of etpub the
         server is running.  Example:
         if(cgs.etpub >= ETPUB_VERSION(0,6,0)) ...
         This could potentially be useful for adding config strings.
* matt:  Added preliminary etpub client documentation
* tjw:   decreased the text size for polls.
* tjw:   added the /hidevote client command.  also, the "stuck vote"
         bug that people experience when joining durring a vote is
         most likely fixed.
* tjw:   updated the vote menu to include new etpub votes
         ("next campaign", "restart campaign", "surrender", and "poll")
* tjw:   used Catscratch's suggestion for putting etpubclient version
         in place of "SERVER INFO" on the loading screen.
* perro: updated client to allow for adjusting stamina recharge rates
         (g_staminaRecharge) and to support g_misc 16 to prevent
         jumping if stamina is below approx 17%.  Updated etpubc.h to show
         20050927
* tjw:   added etpub 0.5.x version detection hack
* tjw:   added version detection for PM_Tracehead() now g_misc 32

         throwing knife, reflected-ff)
         cleaned up minor formatting issue with fireteam invitation text
         that caused two lines to print over one another
* tjw:   implemented g_coverts 2 and 4 flags (see docs)
* tjw:   added menu option for shufflenorestart vote
* tjw:   added scale parameter to "livesleft" HUD element and adjusted
         deej.hud and stumpy.hud to draw this element.  It only gets drawn
         on limited lives server anyway right?

20051030

         (instead of bank 3) when you're a soldier with level 4 Heavy Weapons.

         ([current ammo]/[max ammo])
* tjw:   support for the g_coverts 128 flag

20051103
--------
* josh:  bugfix: Changed PMF_DOUBLEJUMPING bitflag from 65536 to 128 since
         only 16-bits are sent over to the client. This fixes a client bug,
         since it is in bg, but is compiled into the server as well. Double
         jumps should be right now. Thanks Zozz!

         mines and exploding objectives (hopefully).

         even at far range.

* tjw:   initial /loadfont command
* tjw:   massive font change to replace CG_DrawText_Ext() style text
         with CG_Text_Paint_Ext() style text in most places.  This will
         likely create lots of bugs.  sorry.

           On a coding point of view: dynamites are now stored per team and
           not per ally/enemy. This to make dynamite counters work correctly
           when you change team (from now on it will even store the dynas when
           someone is in spec, though they aren't displayed then). The amount
           of stored dynas has been doubled to 8 per team.The dyno counter can
           be completely disabled by the new CVAR cg_dynoCounter. The number of
           dynas that will be displayed can be set on an ally/enemy basis using
           the new CVARS cg_maxTeamDynas and cg_maxEnemyDynas. There won't be
           any gaps between two dynas anymore and when a dynamite explodes it
           will look in the memory if there is another dyna that can be
           displayed
